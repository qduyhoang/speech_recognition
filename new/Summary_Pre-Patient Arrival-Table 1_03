rear which pushed her car seat up almost all the way into the front seat um she was actually in a perfect little pocket she was pretty well conserved her leg was stuck and it was stuck actually in the plastic right here of the car seat so they did 
have to extricate her sheds been awake and alert the whole time she is obviously getting a little sleepy she has significant laceration coming off the left eyes she also has what look like a possibly broken left jaw it was the left leg that was stuck although she is 
complaining of tenderness in her right elbow and right leg as well okay left is cleared no blood so in summary passenger in a by a bus with significant intrusion she was restrained in her car seat had significant intrusion um primary survey negative secondary survey significant for left eye 
swelling laceration uh swelling at the left jaw left arm tenderness discomfort hard to pin point exactly where it is but i think it from shoulder through left wrist bilateral lower extremities with thighs knees ankles swelling and superficial overlying of laceration and abrasion over bilateral lower extremities so two 
concerns right know if this is a femur fracture it was very stable before and its not now if we could just find a way somebody could just straighten that leg out and wrap it that would be great i only have she seems to be in a position of 
comfort lets just go through labs and surest were gonna have standard labs we are gonna get a head ct based on intrusion of the vehicles were going to get a left upper extremity of the upper army elbow forearm and hand views were going to get a pelvis film 
bilateral femur bilateral bilateral feet uh well get as soon as were able um well give her one dose of morphine pain hers a day old full term infants with no prior medical history about a am today he fell from about counter height on to his kitchen floor parent 
brought him hers got some inner cranial bleeds hers been appropriate behaving per parents except a maybe little sleepy no vomiting hers been in since am this morning hers a saline bolus hers five point five kilograms he slept for us along the way has not been medicated for pain 
he could probably benefit from a little something um thats maintenance fluids d five and a half it two zero so lets summarized this our uh six week male status post fall the and outside ct scant stable with a stable at the outside facilities so were likely gonna transfer 
him for exam well get the basic labs and well get the ct from the outside loaded up by the radiologist and well contact our surgery to see if they want any other additional imaging or procedures a its a of year old male that was in the back of 
a golf car unknown speed fell off of hit his head unknown amount of times initially gave him a g c s of of male fell we think off the back of a moving golf carts lost consciousness on seen hers been responsive to vocal commands and alert told oriented 
person place things which is having only complaint right now is back and head hurts hers been on the back board for about an hour now got some road rash on his knees some abrasions and stuff on his face other than that hers in pretty good shape survey complete 
vitals been stable whole time we have had him and then was little bit little bit tacky between like a of a of and then to p pass of on room air no allergies no and no medical history alright were going to conclude our secondary survey at this point 
so we are getting basic labs were putting in a liter of fluid were getting c t head max face bilateral temporal bones anyone have any other concerns at this time mothers arm and landed on his left shoulder and arm he got have some minor deformities to his left 
shoulder he got a small bump on the back of his head no l o c his vitals are beautiful reset of 100 set room air blood pressure a over a over of heart rate right around 200 no medical history no allergies i do have mom look at this 
and left shoulders he does have good movement and color in his left hand alright so at this point we have a neurologically normal child with a left upper extremity deformity thats the only obvious injury since he got a g c s of of we can probably attempt to 
clear his alright to recap we have a neurologically normal a month old who fell from a height of arms no loss of consciousness primary survey nothing on secondary survey he has a deep deformity of his left upper arm were getting a separate trauma labs as soon as we 
can were getting film of a lateral spine as well as shoulder upper arm and elbow evaluated for the deformity and then at this point were going to observe and see what r n g is coming back well get him on ate fluids anyone have any other thoughts any 
other concerns i have an eight year old male who was on a bicycle um little safety restraint um no helmet was struck by an SUV uh sir who was driving the SUV said he was actually dragged a foot or so he has a very bad abrasion here and 
also on the thigh um there is open skin at the actual and at the forearms um small pain two out ten on the thigh the right thigh the blood pressure and blood clots have not drop at all they remain stable at over eighty over um pulse of open
