a a point here okay radial took were getting a radial too we have of pulses his feet are a little cold he has good cap refill less than a seconds of radial pulses of pulses bilaterally we have of pulses his feet are cool okay distal bilateral radial pulses 
intact bilateral pulses intact good pulses bilaterally good distal pulses bilaterally sheds got a good pulse on the left good pulse on the right got a radial pulse on the right airways patent and protected her breath sounds are clear bilaterally she has of pulses bilaterally and one in right 
penis working on his thank you distal pulses and we have palpable peripheral pulses check all four pulses lets go all four pulses present check her pulses man lets go you good bilateral peril pulse and arms bilateral regional pulse squeezing your arms really quick okay of distal pulses all 
around okay femoral pulses bilaterally i got of pt pulses and pulses of radial pulse on the right of on the right of on the left of radial on the left of radial pulse on the right of on the left and the right of of radial on the left 
if i mention that earlier we got of pulses in his uh in his uh and of on the right of on the left yeah pulse is a pulse is radial and DPs are checked just DPs are bilateral check radials please we gotta gotta take your hand ism sorry 
of radial on the right of on the left of DPs bilaterally could somebody check for distal pulses he has right feel bilateral pedal pulses and good cap refills we have good breaths bilaterally intact airway and were going to have a of of when were done with it pulse 
is intact x good pulses general pulse intact and strong bilaterally thank you does he have good blood flow in the distal he does yes times a i have a of right pulse i need your right hand to squeeze of left pulse alright and check pulses in of please 
okay of pulses bilaterally of radial pulses bilaterally hers got good peripheral pulses of cap refill of left pulse okay 200 effective pulses of pulse on the left do you mind saying that a little louder yup and then of pulse on the right he has of radial pulses bilaterally 
his arms are clear of pulses his pupils are poor bilaterally reactive to a the pulses palpable pulses bilaterally we have a palpable radial in the right when you guys are done can you just check the pulse in the left hand i did it was of yeah did you 
check distal pulses of pulse on the right and then of pulse on the left her cap refill is less than a seconds did we do a pulse check can we just do a pulse check thats all i want i just want a pulse ch hold on one second 
were trying okay if we have no rhythm we have no pulse of pulse on the right of pulse on the left her cap refill on the left is and of radial pulse on the right and a of radial pulse on the left distal pulses are good her cap 
refill is brisk she has of pulses airways intact breaths are uh distal pulses uh intact uh radial and distal ism sorry i hear what he said about pulses hers got pulses strong pulses all a yea he had and uh of radial pulses vitals arrived on scene pulse abrasions 
uh the arm left check pulses yup hers got uh of lateral pulses bilaterally and the femoral distal pulses good pulse year good pulse in the femoral hers got distal pulses here on the injured side of okay good hers got good bilateral of pulses in the DPs okay circulation 
check the pulses alright bilateral femoral pulses that are equal got bilateral pulses warm of right femoral of femoral pulses in each leg okay but got good femoral pulses of bilateral femoral pulses of bilateral dorsal penis laterally bilaterally okay distal pulses lets check his distal pulses feel pulses distal 
pulses look good a plus radial pulses bilaterally a plus femoral got a good pulse on the left she got bilateral radial pulses sheds got good posterior fibula pulses check for pulses so lets get a line and get some pulses okay hers got palpable on the right palpable on 
the left ism checking your pulse right now okay good radial pulses femoral pulse intact good femoral pulse intact on this side does he have pulses distal to the injury yes he does yes he has intact radial pulses bilaterally radial pulse is present yes hers got radial pulse in 
both arms hers got good radial pulses and intact distal perfusion and good pedal pulses so pulse is distal yeah sorry i hear that not thats okay a plus and bilateral did you check radial i checked femoral and can you check radial a plus bilateral did we get a 
heart sound yes and i have distal pulses probable distal pulses i have bilateral distal pulses okay pulse is bilateral which pulse is there a plus bps bilaterally check the radials also please i got a plus thank you a plus radial bilaterally thank you okay just get femoral pulses 
real fast of of femoral pulses bilaterally pulses bilaterally so sheds got a low pulse and a high a plus the a plus pulses radial pulses bilaterally you check pulses just redo the whole detected radial pulse on the right checking for pulses bilaterally the radial pulse on the left 
a plus right a plus left two plus right two plus left hers got of right radial hers got of left bps of right bps alright so of uh radial and of pedals bilaterally circulation is intact with pulses ism just feeling your pulses okay alright bud its gonna be
