chest wall tenderness were gonna upload the ct scant and well have our trauma lab depending that will lead us to how hers trending and thats where we are what kind of labs you need basic yeah trauma does it have lasts what stage trauma h and h and um 
hemoglobin and yea thats all i wanted it was hiding his belly do you want any fluids do you need to do any imaging since he lost consciousness id feel safe with a head ct scan so were gonna get some blood work were gonna move to another room were 
gonna get some films of his left forearm and his left knee cause he got squished against the pole buddy well do basic trauma labs did you see the ct not i did not i literally just pulled this stuff out of it what did did she just have a 
head ct thats it head ct showed a a mm depressed yeah i know if we scanned anything else not usually with this age we have to do the neck because not at the risk to get any neck injuries yeah so so that was just neurosurgery so just make 
their way down okay good be great i means he looks pretty vigorous but usually with the depression they like to watch two an hour checks every night at least is that for the pick then yeah pick already knows he looks happy well hers not very happy right now 
but yes let me retract that and say hers appropriately annoyed by the fact that we are messing with him and about to stab him and not letting him eat and about to give him an ivy should i continued if you can continue without getting in her way then 
yeah yeah you need all of the labs did you say basic basic labs okay yeah basic labs thank you it was basic trauma labs well get basic trauma labs nurse if you'll consult get a second read on the head ct gonna upload it um but no labs say 
hospital none do you want basic labs she was so swollen drooling earlier yeah basic yeah its decreased in swelling a lot and secondary for the ct so they come and they brought it they did uploading it now okay so lets take a look at her head ct well 
get basic trauma labs because they get any over there and then i think thats probably it so basic trauma labs is all you need ct saturated ct do you guys want any labs i want labs do you want labs i donate no labs so we know for sure 
well need a lateral spine film well need a ct of his head well need a whatever the comprehensive labs are i think those are standard i have the ready when you guys are whether to get a ct of the face is the only things hers got blood in 
the nose... yeah well were going to head the head so just do the face as well anybody want the results please 730 of 34. chemistries of 39. calcium 1.16. h and h of and 35. base deficit 0.8. glucose lactate 1.3. tell me when you guys are ready for 
the ct yeah were ready for the ct so lets get a spine now then well go over and get a ct of his head his face is stable though right yeah just looks like nasal bridge is swollen lets get a ct of his face then ct face as 
well so we will start with basic trauma labs were gonna get a chest of his shoulder and numerous so imaging of his shoulders his numerous and his chest basic trauma labs and hers gonna get a bolus what are you thinking about for imaging and lab things i have 
my thoughts but i feel like they might want something different do you want them to him now or can we do his leg here do we do the leg now ism fine with that i know what the orders are can we do that yeah just tell him what 
we want so hers having hip pain so we should probably get a pelvis and then he was also complaining of pain the lower leg so a pelvis and a pelvis and tibia sounds good okay alright no you want spine right yes that was part of his... okay pelvis
