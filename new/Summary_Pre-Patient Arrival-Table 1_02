have any other suggestion comments concerns so just so everyone is aware now that we have a full team a year old coming in to transit from an outside hospital her injured cranial bleed fall down a stairs has had a c t head through with a and a possible 
small under brain small has not been intimated at a g c s of of though some concern about the ability to assess of the outside hospital were working on of kilogram weight for a a year old anticipating a minimum now primary and secondary survey and getting the images 
reread and then if the child is looking stable obviously there could be a white until we decide whats there is on top and if its more concerning we can deal with it and at a this morning she was found outside the house and she fell down said about 
a steps which were concrete steps no known loss of consciousness cried immediately dad picked her up put her in the car and started going to the hospital says she fell asleep on the way over so sheds not sure if she truly did loss confess at all but at 
this point reporting no loss of consciousness she when shes asleep verbal pain assimilation wakes her up she responds perfect she wants to be up stretch be in moms arms she has no known history of anything no med no allergies head c t there showed a questionable left notion 
or anything no skull fracture off the chest off of contusion pulmonary contusion says she no no other known restrictions or she has an i v affixed in her right hand she has received no body fluids no medications at the other hospital or transport she has been responding appropriately 
once again in the moms and dads arms guys we are going to summarized so we got a toddler with a concern for an bleed primary survey is unremarkable reassuring g c s given that she is moving her neck we will not put her in a neck splints ism 
sorry cervical collar we will get comprehensive trauma legs actually concern that she has pulmonary contusion possibility in addition to the head we will need to talk to nurse once the c t is uploaded thats happening now i think she has any immediate medication needs and i anticipate transferring 
her to one of our beds going to keep a close eye on her pending the read of the c t Nero search console and then if there is finding on that admission she has an abrasion on her left left side of her back left side back alright well 
summarize real quick this is a of month old female that took fall second two stories with no loss of consciousness reportedly but no witness even with dynamically stable primary survey is negative secondary survey negative as well he has according to mom has had two days of upper respiratory 
infection has had quite a bit of before we move forward can we just someone read off the vitals and then if you have any concern before we move to secondary state them eight twenty one over uh by Dyna map and one ten over by manual uh to summarize 
this is john does unclear age were assuming ten struck while he was riding a scooter by a motor vehicles unclear speed of the vehicles so based on mechanism alone his is thirteen were gonna get a of his head dry were gonna get basic labs hemoglobins and a he 
have any other recognizable deformities besides a small abrasion on his knee and the laceration over the left post of his of year old female hit by a car going about of miles per hour witnesses say there was no loss of consciousness she spoke the entire time patent however 
was repeating questions throughout the ride here asking the same questions over and over again she does have some left leg pain upon movement not upon palpitations sheds got a bunch of abrasion along the right side starting here some on the back of the spine no pain down there 
obviously i v established she does have a contusion to the back of her head shes getting she just started to get a headache just now as we got here peoples pearl the whole time able to speak through the whole ride a out of a times of a except 
for the questioning of where her mother is where her family members where what happened so lets take a moment to summarize of year old pedestrian hit by vehicle about of miles per hours so theoretically stable at this point were going to get rays right shoulder elbow and wrist 
as well as the left femur and then go over for a head c t since she complained of headaches and then spine rays as well and spine as well so was on his bike in a alley and a vehicle struck him on the right side knocked him from 
his bicycle not wearing a helmet but he says he did not loose and his only complaint is to his right leg from ankle to thigh as far as we could tell no deformity he is naturally pigeon toed so both of his feet are turned inward but lung sound 
good pupils good hers moving good air hers alert oriented g c s is 15. so we completed the secondary survey just in summery this is an a year old boy who was hit by a car and was on his bicycle no loss of consciousness most concern is the 
right lower extremity c collar can be cleared i would do it after we get rays going just in case though lets get go ahead and get femur and then lower leg foot just because we canst rule out anything just on the femur well go from there to the
