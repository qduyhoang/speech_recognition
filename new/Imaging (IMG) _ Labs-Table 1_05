get trauma labs yeah so in summary we have a a month old in a um reactor um much no obvious injuries on primary or secondary um were keeping the collar in for now were gonna get a lateral spine we already have negative trauma labs and um so well 
reassess after the thank you ism interested in basic trauma labs from that i did hers getting basic trauma labs and a dose of morphine at handset has been requested uh radiology tested the right knee you need you need you want uh you want blood basic trauma labs please 
yeah basic trauma labs got it okay so once the iv is secured turning the patient to assess and then well figure out what plain films we need likely just get an so we can see see where it is and confirm that its there i think just basics right 
now okay basic trauma labs a can we pull up pull up basic trauma labs alright okay trauma labs have been ordered already thats happening id just do spine and extremity films uh lets start with basic trauma labs so hers gonna need a ct head uh basic trauma labs 
uh probably actually well probably do plain films of the neck uh were gonna do plain films of the neck to clear it do you guys want to put do you change out to do you leave those if if a good fit you leave it but if not i 
mean if happy with it i think i think we can probably clear him after plain films so i think hers gonna be in it for a long time so were gonna get a ct head trauma labs and okay do you need me to hold spine to or do 
you think hers okay uh not you need to hold well just let it hang and then well probably want to get trauma labs and an iv and do basic trauma labs that would be great uh yes well do right femur knee and tibia basic on the left yea 
basic labs basic labs have right um overall primary survey was negative secondary survey was most notable for um significant pain to the right lower extremity uh e and uh leg lower leg and then a small abrasion on his nose so basic trauma labs weave gotten morphines get a 
flu and rays of the right lower extremity you did get labs yeah they were all normal so were gonna go look at the pictures so no labs hers already got labs correct no labs yes no labs we just need to roll him did we do that already yes 
we did on the other side okay so and well check well check the urine for a thats the only lab and well get a pelvis view guys drawing basic trauma labs we need we need a better flask oh it means that were just gonna use a little flask 
over here your blood want to come out of this like this this part so were just gonna were just gonna use a very very thing to get some blood out okay ground reasonable to see a chest is it gonna hurt it will probably feel less than what i 
just did alright ism okay holding off on the chest uh we get chest rays on the grounds of that no obvious injuries on primary secondary survey but given the mechanism and the symptoms well get a head ct and a uh cervical spine anything else anyone can think of 
do you want any labs uh yeah we have basic labs you want basic labs yeah um can we get some blood gas and labs too uh do i wanna get a bedside gas see what you can get and otherwise can i get with a get to a femoral 
stat for blood for a gas if they get it were going to try and get blood for a gas were gonna tears gear up to do a femoral stat to do that um and lets work on getting access well send the uh complete trauma labs complete labs and 
a dose of morphine soon thereafter please so once were done getting the blood well roll her do her back and then lets get a chest cause sheds got a proximal left upper extremity deformity and that could also have a clavicle fracture can you repeat that i heard chest 
what else do you want so sheds got a proximal humerus injury so ism thinking chest with the clavicle which is my indication for the chest and then humerus you want rays of that so rays of bilateral upper extremities which necessary have the clavicle in it and then were 
gonna send full trauma labs and a lateral spine you said full trauma labs yeah is that enough right thats enough right yeah perfect all i need is that enough i got of a more okay sounds good if she did nobody told they order anymore blood works just the 
arm x rays humerus deformed do you want a or just a just arm her hands look fine right hands look fine just the humerus and forearm doing this army so the right upper yeah bilaterally is it easier for you guys to do all the imaging together are they 
gonna shoot all the basic extremities in here or are they gonna bring her to radiology no worries towel towel yup no well get the spine here but thats all okay just the spine start getting access and plan to send basic trauma labs do you want labs for her 
i think we should be okay basic trauma labs how are we doing on labs and access so you said basic trauma labs do you want add anything alright so lets do basic trauma labs and a lateral sequent film tell her they want a lateral spine alright so it
