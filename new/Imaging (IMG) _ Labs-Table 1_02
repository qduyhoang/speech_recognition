sheds not letting me get like a perfectly thorough neural exam but maybe well just see whats going on with the rays and then ill come back so are you okay if with transfer her to this way or do you want some type of immobilization were praying here so 
ism go to give the morphine after the right but if she needs it while sheds being manipulated in the and that clear her that she be on position of comfort she on the right right now no until we decide when we have an idea of what were dealing 
with based on rays so the only gotten so far is that neck or is it the chest good so sheds moving these well something ism worried about is possibly something here cause she kind of keeps her arm on so were gonna get an this one seem as bad 
sheds moving this a little bit more it really bother her i want to move that around just in case something is bad i want her to get hurt so i think she was holding sorry just because of sort of the bruising here were gonna get rays for all 
of her lower extremity but ism a little bit less worried about this one than this one and sheds complaint of a little bit more pain in this one were gonna get rays here um and you know were gonna get the so i canst tell you anything for know
