a temporal bone c to alright are you ready to do the x rays so hers gonna get a on that army yes not um i think so i think he needs an so what were gonna do uh no i would leave him in for now just because of 
distracting injury and were giving him the morphines ill leave it in the collar i would scan his head just based on the mechanism yeah um i wanna get a chest just to make sure theres no other fracture there just purely based on mechanism but um we can get 
a film of his right thigh to make sure he have any femur fracture there um and then well do a basic set of trauma labs and uh wound pair and well talk to no arm just to make sure he its not because he has full function of his 
arm yeah well get him off the board right femur chest and basic trauma labs then what were gonna do after log rolling is replace the collar though were not gonna get a film of the spine oh we can do yeah no well do lateral spine and then well 
take him to well go to ct first and then we can do lateral spine chest right thigh well do right arm as well and then uh and then basically plus or minus or for wash up okay so to repeat basic trauma labs chest right thigh spine ct scan 
head right arm thank you okay we ready for gonna do the arms for the spine is ready so i just spoke to i just spoke to um were gonna do the joint and the forearm thats what requesting but they say if its purely soft tissues and theres no 
fracture joint involvement which i think is the cases i think its purely soft tissues then to call plastics he think that if its nothing thats at the bedside he said be something like specialty specific either or plastics regarding the location high muscles soft tissue bone exposure so well 
call plastics after is done i can even call them now and tell them thats gonna be the plan yeah so this this ct six point six on the calcium okay x ray we have to put the plate under him for his chest gonna roll him towards me and
