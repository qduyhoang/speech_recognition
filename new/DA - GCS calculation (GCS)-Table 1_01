responding and her verbal response is what so what would you rate so what was eyes so she would be a of of she spontaneously open her eyes talking to me and sheds localizing the pain following commands so localizing the pain that would be a of only before during 
speech pump the breaks so g c s and pupil size pupil size is did you pass out or anything just hit the arm not a hard hit that stun you or anything for a second how old yeah alright well see you later any loss of consciousness in the 
scene yes okay hers been awake and talking no non verbal so hers not responding to sternal rub were not getting any response okay so whats his lets see of four for four for eyes one for verbal and ism not getting any response for motor so one for motor 
but let me try again so probably six as of right now six okay hers moving a little bit hers moving a little bit so seven i would say four for pain so a is his eye opening or not eyes open well spontaneous spontaneous is that a bold yes 
or not no theres nothing for verbal and motor to pain motor hers kind of withdrawing a little bit seven we have of seven so you got a of seven what you get i got four one five then if we do pain then thats a nine if we do 
it just to none then thats were somewhere in between there okay thats fine uh his is like somewhere between a seven and nine not really responsive were gonna intubate him but the kid was in a motor vehicle accident uh coming in with loss of consciousness uh declining motor 
so concern for head injury the only thing we have not done actually is for us is we have not woke him to double check what his motion is uh she got a little bit of retrograde amnesia sheds not answering question appropriately sheds uh a little bit combative four
