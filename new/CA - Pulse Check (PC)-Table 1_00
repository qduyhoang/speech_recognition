speech plus two pulses on the left pulse is equal bilaterally intact right trigonal full store extremities no deformities no pulses he has of bilateral radial pulses of pulses so she has good pulses in her left lower extremity she is complaining of pain ah in her thigh and 
it is externally rotated we have a pulses of pulses verse capsules pulses circulation intact he got of uh pulses peripherally got good femoral pulses airways patent hers got equal breath sounds bilaterally sound are good hers got distal pulse at upright extremity got of distal pulses bilateral lower extremity 
pulse on the right pulse on the left her right lower extremity is clear her left lower extremity is clear her right upper extremity is clear plus radial pulse her right her right upper extremity is clear plus radial pulse theres of radial on the left bilateral pulses of pull 
through pulses ism sorry can you go back did you do pulse yet yeah still intact radially and bilaterally good pulses good pulses of of pulses bilaterally he has pulses bilateral lower extremities k skin warm good pulses everywhere so good pulses right lower extremity no obvious deformity but pain 
of left pulse alright did you get a on that extremity i have a good right i can feel a radial pulse would you mind were just gonna take some pulses here i have ism gonna call it a of rank pulse okay of as well pulse we have pulse 
present the radial seems fine decent pulses okay and i think you know even though she says not when she actually makes movement she just feels bad when i was touching her uh and all of her pulses are good so blood is getting to her fingers and toes pulse 
is equal bilaterally of pulses on the left ism sorry i hear what he said about pulses yeah sheds got bilateral pulses their good sheds going at of right now of right now you said thats what i saw a second ago yeah yup on the monitors during after after 
after during speech two plus radial pulse on the right two plus pulse on the right as well two plus pulse on the left two plus radial pulse on the left side okay check the pulses check the pulses do we have pulses yeah we have one two plus pulses 
two plus it the pulses so in summary this is a of year old female who fell while doing gymnastics first loss of consciousness right now presentation g c s of of other then that baited airway she has heightened access on the right a c bilateral pulses and no 
other significant issues and second survey she have any open lacerations or anything so hers got a strong dorsal penis pulse on the right hers got a strong dorsal penis pulse on the left as well hers got good dorsal penis pulses he has dorsal penis pulses yes of radial 
on the right okay of on the left radial okay of on the right and the left and the left okay of femoral on the uh left okay of on the right okay of palpate on the left of on the right theres a second over there if you want 
a different one is it not working no its fine some people prefer the simpler version do we have is there lube there why you test where your pulse is gonna be crackling noise move your toes toes look good could you not wiggle your toes for a minutes i 
want to feel for a pulse could you clear the monitor just keep your toes straight just for a second that would be impressive if it went through both keep going keep going keep going a more there you go you definitely felt the boundary it just came all the 
way down keep your toes straight press down with the gas pedal on the hands and move with your legs up and you can feel me touching on both legs uh yeah giving bilateral alright femoral pulse is a plus and equal bilaterally of bilaterally so yea lets get pulses 
on so get a pulses you call pulses of radial pulses of femoral pulses of pulse on the left of pulse on the right cap refill is less than a seconds um no evidence of shock well wait for the uh blood pressure but good cap refill pulses heart rate 
is 150 right now is pupils are equal and reactive the right upper extremity is a of pulse looks good no signs of trauma of pulse on the left and no signs of trauma to the left upper extremity uh of radial pulses uh bilaterally of femoral pulses bilaterally uh 
how we doing on blood pressure and pulse coming the monitors not picking up of the wave forms not picking up sorry my dear of DPs bilaterally is 15. do you know where you are hers got bilateral radius pulses hers got bilateral pulses of over got bilateral radial pulses 
got bilateral pulses check pulses can you check the pulses and the got good radial pulses bilaterally good pulses bilaterally check femoral pulses took just because its near the area and let me know if theres any bleeding right there well theres bleeding in the right scrotum alright hers got 
good femoral pulses bilaterally of pulses bilaterally his skin is warm no iv access okay check the pulses how are the pulses are usually are where weave been feeling them well left and right femoral pulses are they strong good yeah good i got a of over okay sheds got
