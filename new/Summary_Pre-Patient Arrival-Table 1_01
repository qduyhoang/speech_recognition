was a chair at the bottom of the window the window was open she was conscious crying want us to help her it took a little to console her got her down once we got her on the ground we notice that her right leg is rotated out not if 
it rotated out and there is a little bit of deformity right there left leg left leg i do i did eventually get an iv in the left act of her pressure has been stable the whole time no abdominal rigidity no pain no chest head all intact nothing in 
the head pupils were equal and reactive some blood from the mouth and nose and some blood on the ground appear to be any damage there and sheds been talking to us and everything the whole time throughout has been she does not know what happened and she does not 
know what happen she does not know if she was up stair or down on the ground and she does not have the ability to move her left leg that should be good her vitals were normal all stable she was slightly like around 130 when she saw her mom 
about 150. blood sugar was 140 her airway is patent and protected breathe sounds are cleared bilaterally we have two plus pulses bilaterally lower extremities her cap refill is about a seconds a to of its a on the right its a little delay a on the left so we 
are going to do a summary real quick this is our a year old who likely fell out of a third story window approximately of feet was found without loss of consciousness at the scene normal vitals brought in primary survey is intact including a of 15. on secondary survey 
help me with this because i missed some of the stuff she got dried blood on her hands and nose and a deformity of her left femur thats tender but otherwise no other findings she was also complaining of some mild cervical discomfort some right clavicle discomfort none of these 
have any deformity or obvious zero pain and also some belly pain and her abdomen is a little distended so she is getting a bolus of of per kilo of l r that is already running sheds gotten of for the pain score of a out of we are going 
to get a lateral spine which we can do here and then she is gonna get a pelvic and left femur to rule out a fracture why we add on a two view of the right clavicle i know where n a l is and we have sent basic labs 
that includes and a right so lets just do a summary for he is a of to of year old was hit by a car of miles an hour no vitals stable in the field primary survey intact secondary survey significant for an abrasion and some tenderness over the right 
hip and thigh he should get some morphine cause his pain score was a to a out of of so we could do that he is getting an of a liter through his of he has basic labs that will be sent and then a pelvic in addition to a 
to the right femur and his spine has been clinically cleared alright so vitals are fine not in shock all intact is 15. ill summarize overall here so were here with of minutes in this Angelo hers Angelo of year old male no significant medical history other than his left 
ankle surgery he was standing on a wall fell about of feet no loss of consciousness was of at the scene and both here are all intact from that stand point only obvious injury we can see on secondary survey is hers got abrasion on the right forehead obvious deformity 
a left wrist or distal forearm and hers got some old abrasion maybe on the right knee maybe a fresh one on the left from there in term of we got his c spine immobilized although i think hell be able to clear clinically but well get lateral c spines 
behind films for him and well also get plain films of the left wrist and i think we should get the distal forearms at hand as well just give him the location of it from there well get basic labs and pending all that imaging i think that well attempt 
too see what we can do with the c spine from there of year old football player that had an injury and fell during football today no lock but sleepy and lethargic is i asked them to place a saline lock and immobile his they said alert and oriented but 
sleepy and lethargic so ism a little confuse okay of year old here football practice had a fall no loss of consciousness but is slightly in 14. well reevaluate here our estimated weight is of kilo stats were good vitals were fine good impulses this is hers of year old 
male he was playing kickball on a hard surface he collided with another player head first fell down he was sluggish when he woke up they place a of like 13. hers been at a of of for us remembers the whole incident small through his head other than that 
thats it so basically this is a of year old male with a kickball injury is that right fall during kickballs some initial alter now is 15. you know diagnosis possible concussion hers stable we can just move him to the ed and observe him waiting for his family anybody
