speech plus two pulses on the left pulse is equal bilaterally intact right trigonal full store extremities no deformities no pulses he has of bilateral radial pulses of pulses so she has good pulses in her left lower extremity she is complaining of pain ah in her thigh and 
it is externally rotated we have a pulses of pulses verse capsules pulses circulation intact he got of uh pulses peripherally got good femoral pulses airways patent hers got equal breath sounds bilaterally sound are good hers got distal pulse at upright extremity got of distal pulses bilateral lower extremity 
pulse on the right pulse on the left her right lower extremity is clear her left lower extremity is clear her right upper extremity is clear plus radial pulse her right her right upper extremity is clear plus radial pulse theres of radial on the left bilateral pulses of pull 
through pulses ism sorry can you go back did you do pulse yet yeah still intact radially and bilaterally good pulses good pulses of of pulses bilaterally he has pulses bilateral lower extremities k skin warm good pulses everywhere so good pulses right lower extremity no obvious deformity but pain 
of left pulse alright did you get a on that extremity i have a good right i can feel a radial pulse would you mind were just gonna take some pulses here i have ism gonna call it a of rank pulse okay of as well pulse we have pulse 
present the radial seems fine decent pulses okay and i think you know even though she says not when she actually makes movement she just feels bad when i was touching her uh and all of her pulses are good so blood is getting to her fingers and toes pulse 
is equal bilaterally of pulses on the left ism sorry i hear what he said about pulses yeah sheds got bilateral pulses their good sheds going at of right now of right now you said thats what i saw a second ago yeah yup on the monitors during after after 
after during speech two plus radial pulse on the right two plus pulse on the right as well two plus pulse on the left two plus radial pulse on the left side okay check the pulses check the pulses do we have pulses yeah we have one two plus pulses 
two plus it the pulses so in summary this is a of year old female who fell while doing gymnastics first loss of consciousness right now presentation g c s of of other then that baited airway she has heightened access on the right a c bilateral pulses and no 
other significant issues and second survey she have any open lacerations or anything so hers got a strong dorsal penis pulse on the right hers got a strong dorsal penis pulse on the left as well hers got good dorsal penis pulses he has dorsal penis pulses yes of radial 
on the right okay of on the left radial okay of on the right and the left and the left okay of femoral on the uh left okay of on the right okay of palpate on the left of on the right theres a second over there if you want 
a different one is it not working no its fine some people prefer the simpler version do we have is there lube there why you test where your pulse is gonna be crackling noise move your toes toes look good could you not wiggle your toes for a minutes i 
want to feel for a pulse could you clear the monitor just keep your toes straight just for a second that would be impressive if it went through both keep going keep going keep going a more there you go you definitely felt the boundary it just came all the 
way down keep your toes straight press down with the gas pedal on the hands and move with your legs up and you can feel me touching on both legs uh yeah giving bilateral alright femoral pulse is a plus and equal bilaterally of bilaterally so yea lets get pulses 
on so get a pulses you call pulses of radial pulses of femoral pulses of pulse on the left of pulse on the right cap refill is less than a seconds um no evidence of shock well wait for the uh blood pressure but good cap refill pulses heart rate 
is 150 right now is pupils are equal and reactive the right upper extremity is a of pulse looks good no signs of trauma of pulse on the left and no signs of trauma to the left upper extremity uh of radial pulses uh bilaterally of femoral pulses bilaterally uh 
how we doing on blood pressure and pulse coming the monitors not picking up of the wave forms not picking up sorry my dear of DPs bilaterally is 15. do you know where you are hers got bilateral radius pulses hers got bilateral pulses of over got bilateral radial pulses 
got bilateral pulses check pulses can you check the pulses and the got good radial pulses bilaterally good pulses bilaterally check femoral pulses took just because its near the area and let me know if theres any bleeding right there well theres bleeding in the right scrotum alright hers got 
good femoral pulses bilaterally of pulses bilaterally his skin is warm no iv access okay check the pulses how are the pulses are usually are where weave been feeling them well left and right femoral pulses are they strong good yeah good i got a of over okay sheds got 
a a point here okay radial took were getting a radial too we have of pulses his feet are a little cold he has good cap refill less than a seconds of radial pulses of pulses bilaterally we have of pulses his feet are cool okay distal bilateral radial pulses 
intact bilateral pulses intact good pulses bilaterally good distal pulses bilaterally sheds got a good pulse on the left good pulse on the right got a radial pulse on the right airways patent and protected her breath sounds are clear bilaterally she has of pulses bilaterally and one in right 
penis working on his thank you distal pulses and we have palpable peripheral pulses check all four pulses lets go all four pulses present check her pulses man lets go you good bilateral peril pulse and arms bilateral regional pulse squeezing your arms really quick okay of distal pulses all 
around okay femoral pulses bilaterally i got of pt pulses and pulses of radial pulse on the right of on the right of on the left of radial on the left of radial pulse on the right of on the left and the right of of radial on the left 
if i mention that earlier we got of pulses in his uh in his uh and of on the right of on the left yeah pulse is a pulse is radial and DPs are checked just DPs are bilateral check radials please we gotta gotta take your hand ism sorry 
of radial on the right of on the left of DPs bilaterally could somebody check for distal pulses he has right feel bilateral pedal pulses and good cap refills we have good breaths bilaterally intact airway and were going to have a of of when were done with it pulse 
is intact x good pulses general pulse intact and strong bilaterally thank you does he have good blood flow in the distal he does yes times a i have a of right pulse i need your right hand to squeeze of left pulse alright and check pulses in of please 
okay of pulses bilaterally of radial pulses bilaterally hers got good peripheral pulses of cap refill of left pulse okay 200 effective pulses of pulse on the left do you mind saying that a little louder yup and then of pulse on the right he has of radial pulses bilaterally 
his arms are clear of pulses his pupils are poor bilaterally reactive to a the pulses palpable pulses bilaterally we have a palpable radial in the right when you guys are done can you just check the pulse in the left hand i did it was of yeah did you 
check distal pulses of pulse on the right and then of pulse on the left her cap refill is less than a seconds did we do a pulse check can we just do a pulse check thats all i want i just want a pulse ch hold on one second 
were trying okay if we have no rhythm we have no pulse of pulse on the right of pulse on the left her cap refill on the left is and of radial pulse on the right and a of radial pulse on the left distal pulses are good her cap 
refill is brisk she has of pulses airways intact breaths are uh distal pulses uh intact uh radial and distal ism sorry i hear what he said about pulses hers got pulses strong pulses all a yea he had and uh of radial pulses vitals arrived on scene pulse abrasions 
uh the arm left check pulses yup hers got uh of lateral pulses bilaterally and the femoral distal pulses good pulse year good pulse in the femoral hers got distal pulses here on the injured side of okay good hers got good bilateral of pulses in the DPs okay circulation 
check the pulses alright bilateral femoral pulses that are equal got bilateral pulses warm of right femoral of femoral pulses in each leg okay but got good femoral pulses of bilateral femoral pulses of bilateral dorsal penis laterally bilaterally okay distal pulses lets check his distal pulses feel pulses distal 
pulses look good a plus radial pulses bilaterally a plus femoral got a good pulse on the left she got bilateral radial pulses sheds got good posterior fibula pulses check for pulses so lets get a line and get some pulses okay hers got palpable on the right palpable on 
the left ism checking your pulse right now okay good radial pulses femoral pulse intact good femoral pulse intact on this side does he have pulses distal to the injury yes he does yes he has intact radial pulses bilaterally radial pulse is present yes hers got radial pulse in 
both arms hers got good radial pulses and intact distal perfusion and good pedal pulses so pulse is distal yeah sorry i hear that not thats okay a plus and bilateral did you check radial i checked femoral and can you check radial a plus bilateral did we get a 
heart sound yes and i have distal pulses probable distal pulses i have bilateral distal pulses okay pulse is bilateral which pulse is there a plus bps bilaterally check the radials also please i got a plus thank you a plus radial bilaterally thank you okay just get femoral pulses 
real fast of of femoral pulses bilaterally pulses bilaterally so sheds got a low pulse and a high a plus the a plus pulses radial pulses bilaterally you check pulses just redo the whole detected radial pulse on the right checking for pulses bilaterally the radial pulse on the left 
a plus right a plus left two plus right two plus left hers got of right radial hers got of left bps of right bps alright so of uh radial and of pedals bilaterally circulation is intact with pulses ism just feeling your pulses okay alright bud its gonna be 
a little tight good pulses can we put the pads on start to see if we have a pulse no pulse in the left femoral when we do lets do a pulse check real quick as well hold on hold on lets do a pulse check pulse check pulse check 
somebody needs to check a pulse or do compressions no pulse on the right femoral is there a rhythm on the strip on the on the monitor we have none so continuing alright next pulse ism ready to check are you ready to check are you in the best position 
do you want the bed raised ism actually okay with the bed height i would prefer the patient to be closer to me somebody check for a pulse check pulse check pulse femoral no pulse felt on the right femoral continue compressions continuing compressions you have pea thats pea we 
have pea alright resume compressions resume compressions get and then gonna check in i can check while were doing compressions okay okay so check we need to confirm its of pulse on the left got it of pulse on the right thank you though we have good pulses his cap 
refill is a to of his vitals are stable his heart rate is his pressure is and title is 37. and what is that noise signaling we got about of palpable femoral from the right side yup good distal pulses um his airway was intact hers got breath sounds bilaterally 
um blood pressure was 132 on the right side good distal pulses fracture right here ism sorry pulses are intact his lungs are clear of bilaterally he has a of pulse on the left cap refill is less than two seconds cap refill is less than two seconds on the 
right and he has a two plus pulse on the right and he has a plus radial pulses bilaterally a plus pulses equal bilateral pulses can you check the radials too please a right radial checking blood pressure on the left a plus pulses got a a plus right radial 
pulse significant deformity to the right humerus okay but i just i just said a plus right radial pulse so airways intact breath sounds are clear bilaterally hers got of pulses in all a extremities hers opening his eyes spontaneously hers cooing and and hers having normal and spontaneous movement 
so of 15. did you check on radial yeah external genitalia normal of femoral pulses move your feet for me i need you to move your feet thank you stop i canst move move your right foot i canst you can doing it his feet are cool but he has 
good pulses has good pulses bilaterally lower extremities can we get him a pulse please i think his pulse is 56. i hope not yeah do we have a pulse okay so we have distal pulses or blood pressure alright hers got bilateral equal breath sounds pedal pulses exposed of 
cause hers just crying and we got him exposed to take a look at his back hers got a right of check left we need bilateral bilateral yes always bilateral careful careful careful careful guys hers got a good left took abdomen is soft and pelvis is stable external genitalia 
appears normal bilateral lower extremities anteriorly are right upper extremities clear hers got a of right radial pulse left axial is clear left upper extremity appears and hers got a of left radial pulse his eyes are clear could you get me some femoral pulse thanks bilateral femoral pulses strong 
and regular radial pulse right lower extremity is clear palpable pulse on the right palpable pulse on the left radial pulse sorry alright so did you check the femoral pulses not i did not i checked the radial pulses on both sides you have to check both sides alright so 
i have a i have plus femoral pulses on both sides
