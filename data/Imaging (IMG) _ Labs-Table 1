speech tell them c t head temporal cuts yeah exactly and noes you want to do maxwell face as well or you want to do the lateral c spine here or yeah c spine chest or the x rays c t of the max and face yeah well the 
head c t is going to have whats called temporal cuts so they cut closer around the bones where they keep the blood in the temporal cause if you do two wide you might miss a fracture so they have to be very fine cuts and what is it called 
a temporal bone c to alright are you ready to do the x rays so hers gonna get a on that army yes not um i think so i think he needs an so what were gonna do uh no i would leave him in for now just because of 
distracting injury and were giving him the morphines ill leave it in the collar i would scan his head just based on the mechanism yeah um i wanna get a chest just to make sure theres no other fracture there just purely based on mechanism but um we can get 
a film of his right thigh to make sure he have any femur fracture there um and then well do a basic set of trauma labs and uh wound pair and well talk to no arm just to make sure he its not because he has full function of his 
arm yeah well get him off the board right femur chest and basic trauma labs then what were gonna do after log rolling is replace the collar though were not gonna get a film of the spine oh we can do yeah no well do lateral spine and then well 
take him to well go to ct first and then we can do lateral spine chest right thigh well do right arm as well and then uh and then basically plus or minus or for wash up okay so to repeat basic trauma labs chest right thigh spine ct scan 
head right arm thank you okay we ready for gonna do the arms for the spine is ready so i just spoke to i just spoke to um were gonna do the joint and the forearm thats what requesting but they say if its purely soft tissues and theres no 
fracture joint involvement which i think is the cases i think its purely soft tissues then to call plastics he think that if its nothing thats at the bedside he said be something like specialty specific either or plastics regarding the location high muscles soft tissue bone exposure so well 
call plastics after is done i can even call them now and tell them thats gonna be the plan yeah so this this ct six point six on the calcium okay x ray we have to put the plate under him for his chest gonna roll him towards me and 
put the plates on that side they said it was forearm elbow so make sure its forearm elbow they want to do the elbow and the forearm and then the femur for and the ct head its over and yep so were gonna have additional rays on his arms and 
legs were gonna do that so you want basic trauma labs yeah well get a basic set as far as rays concerned what do you want so ism going to want left clavicle upper arm elbow left clavicle you want elbow rays first oh were doing now well do rays 
then let you come up just gonna pull the arms i want to ask him how to put it in k putting in the clavicle the only thing ism getting when i type it in is clavicle h could you put that one in put it under her yeah clavicle 
its going to 38. i think a 90. do do the whole rays here or not forearm only other injury is a contusion to the back of the head but were not going to c t were just gonna monitor it and it looked like there is no need for 
a chest x rays do you want to do the film here so mom we will be taking the x ray in a moment so we will have you step back around the corner there and then you can come right back alright so we have the inaudible plan for 
him hers going to get a whole bunch of hers going to get a whole bunch of labs were taking whereas the the chest shows no evidence of a a if there any question on his mental status well just go ahead and scan his head if that develops but 
well watch him closely in other well just get plain film of the left shoulders to start with do we have a plain film at all just like lower series so well get film of the spine as well just plain film just the right just the spine yeah definitely 
it just the to the guys with respect lets start getting baby girl take a deep breath good job we are going to take a quick picture just a picture just a picture sweetie put your arms up in the air we got to take one more picture we got

well get you another room and hang out hopefully once we get your rays back we will so basic lab and what imaging do you want so i was just gonna get basic labs neck film for the left wrist from there that was it i think the abrasion on 
the right is old and well also get plain films of the left wrist and i think we should get the distal forearms at hand as well just give him the location of it from there well get basic labs and pending all that imaging i think that well attempt 
too see what we can do with the c spine from there so well get his spine here and then move him to his room sure is the spine okay spine order is in ready so i think we have everything done um it sounds more like a concussion so 
i feel like i want to image him i want any fluids um were just gonna observe him wait for his family were just gonna do an of his jaw just to make sure theres no fracture there probably just a bruise from his mouth and everything then giving him 
some for pain and well let him slowly drink and be that alright just start relaxing your arms okay alright you all ready for the alright you go ahead and pull so we wanted teen size film left shoulder as well we only got one two three four five a

is done right yeah spine done i know they a there is no need for a chest x rays x rays pull down x rays hers gonna get a ct a lateral like spine or neck neck just cause hers gonna be hard to assess you know lateral neck is 
fine were not doing ct of the neck just the head but lateral neck ct should be ready we called them earlier ct ready yep yeah its ready here we go so after the ct hers charged and where will he be going no labs oh rays code here were 
just trying to get your shoulders out of the picture try to relax your shoulders and look straight up at the sky sheds pulling your arms down so we can see your nave so put it at of and a of shes shes in pain with me right in her

far down do you want to see thought i need i need i need to see we need to see all the separate separate spine i cannot see the last of we can try one more time if you want but other than that i think were just going to 
accept that its can we just try one more are we going to do the other rays after c t or they we gonna be doing the like the other rays in the room cause this bed is so small i think so just going to get me a lab 
he had pain in the legs so might need an yes cause i think it only needs one person to go to so yes ism going to call for that right now and so he was on his bike car comes up unknown speed knocks him off of his bike 
he wearing a helmet but clearly remembers he did not lose consciousness and his primary complaint has been easily foot to about thigh pain tenderness a lot no obvious deformities but tenders a lot when you touch right at his knee anywhere so were going to make sure he does 
not distal femur or lower so those will have the rays and he just got morphine a milligrams with a weight of of kilos and how about the right hip femur and below just just femur and below gotcha like pelvis is stable so i think we are on that 
thought and i am going to call for a room right now while he goes to rays ready for you hers going to another room for the an is ready ism not sure what you talking about that thats were getting ready to go someplace else and move on to 
an table so it will all be different in a sect ism sorry i get all of those i was trying to keep up with you rays yeah so pelvis bilateral femur bilateral knees bilateral fibs bilateral lower legs for the left upper extremity uh humorous elbows radial ulna and 
sheds not letting me get like a perfectly thorough neural exam but maybe well just see whats going on with the rays and then ill come back so are you okay if with transfer her to this way or do you want some type of immobilization were praying here so 
ism go to give the morphine after the right but if she needs it while sheds being manipulated in the and that clear her that she be on position of comfort she on the right right now no until we decide when we have an idea of what were dealing 
with based on rays so the only gotten so far is that neck or is it the chest good so sheds moving these well something ism worried about is possibly something here cause she kind of keeps her arm on so were gonna get an this one seem as bad 
sheds moving this a little bit more it really bother her i want to move that around just in case something is bad i want her to get hurt so i think she was holding sorry just because of sort of the bruising here were gonna get rays for all 
of her lower extremity but ism a little bit less worried about this one than this one and sheds complaint of a little bit more pain in this one were gonna get rays here um and you know were gonna get the so i canst tell you anything for know 
but well just kind of take a look and see whats going on c spine chest or the x rays alright are you ready to do the x rays as far as rays concerned what do you want rays first oh were doing now well do rays then let you 
come up how how many rays do you need a more a more yeah less can be elbow right i mean the alt forearm the lateral elbow and lateral alright get his arm in position so i have to move the position so hers gonna get a on that army 
yes not um i think so i think he needs an so what were gonna do yeah um i wanna get a chest just to make sure theres no other fracture there just purely based on mechanism but um we can get a film of his right thigh to make 
sure he have any femur fracture there um and then well do a basic set of trauma labs and uh wound pair and well talk to right femur chest and basic trauma labs then what were gonna do after log rolling is replace the collar though were not gonna get 
a film of the spine oh we can do yeah no well do lateral spine and then well take him to well go to ct first and then we can do lateral spine chest right thigh well do right arm as well and then uh and then basically plus or 
minus or for wash up okay so to repeat basic trauma labs chest right thigh spine ct scan head right arm thank you okay we ready for gonna do the arms for the spine is ready so i just spoke to i just spoke to um were gonna do the 
joint and the forearm thats what requesting but they say if its purely soft tissues and theres no fracture joint involvement which i think is the cases i think its purely soft tissues then to call plastics he think that if its nothing thats at the bedside he said be 
something like specialty specific either or plastics regarding the location high muscles soft tissue bone exposure so well call plastics after is done i can even call them now and tell them thats gonna be the plan okay rest your shoulders i want your shoulders down there we go buddy

then the femur for and the ct head so were gonna have additional rays on his arms and legs were gonna do that chest rays as well as c spine basic labs chest and c spine i have the rays ready ism waiting for the rays to pop up speech 
lets get a of lab panel for blood work head ct spine lets get a film so we can confirm placement sure sure yeah yeah can we get the transfer monitors ready were gonna need to hook him up and try to get him in the scanner in the next 
ten minutes alright its seventeen o nine ten minutes to get to scanners so lets get that now lets get the transfer motor on nurse wright get the drawn up okay yeah thats fine just get the on the backboard thats fine ready when you guys are uh thank you

labs right yes but were gonna draw more labs were doing a big no more were just doing a big okay weave done so many things blood gas yup probably needs a repeat for eyes cause sheds got an ff and blood just for the just for the blood gas 
yeah yeah yeah do everything we can that was just fill enough for equal so as soon as they put the back push back on we should get a chest check the tube placement so they did not do a cap yeah they just did a okay and did you 
do a urine whats that okay we can do that and whats the other thing you said they do a post ant they just did a so you have to get the less so so were just gonna get you wanna repeat i have a hemoglobins i have a unless 
you want it just repeated with our basic labs yeah i think lets do basic labs okay alright were getting basic labs guys did you want a urine took you want a urine too yeah okay we need a urine and basic okay so thats it thats the full exam 
so guess we just have to look at the radiology but theres nothing on exam abnormal great so we need a basic trauma labs and well look at the ct and kind of decide from that alright did you guys get those labs were gonna do a comprehensive set of 
labs um head ct with maximal facial ct and lateral is there any bruising or anything on her head well get basic labs lateral plain film and then a head ct so she needs like basic trauma labs and you want some more basic trauma said basic yeah basic right 
spine films basic trauma labs hers doing okay hey head and plain films and spine or would you just ct not just get no just uh uh like a plain film plain film ct of the head anything else uh the disk for the head ct basic trauma labs yeah 
basic labs thank you you wanna see how the ct is going alright here you go this is just another one extra just in case they ask you ran chest abdomen pelvis um so do we already have images or so were getting basic labs were gonna look at the 
ct we need any other images right now neurosurgery's here gonna evaluate and you have the ct scans for us yeah thank you can we uh get the ct scan uploaded for a second read please by radiology thank you if you put that order in verbally weed appreciate it 
lets get the head of the bed elevated guys were gonna keep the head of the bed elevated until we get the ct uploading it for a second ready that was the issue right and then was brought to outside hospital had a ct scan that showed skull fracture and 
a year small small and acted lethargic at that point only findings on primary and secondary survey was the scalp correct left parietal left parietal alright so were gonna upload the ct head uh were gonna do skeletal survey and well do an at labs what labs at radiology do 
you want i agree ism comfortable without any labs or any imaging went ahead and did some various labs asp alt were elevated so they did a ct belly which showed a grade point liver lac um initially there was a single point drop in hemoglobins hours a and hour 
a were stable and theres a hemoglobins that you have in total or a probably in a a i think hers stable to go to the floor just based on the labs we got before but well repeat the set here just the basic trauma labs and then just monitor 
him you need trauma labs done on him were getting basic labs thank you so the plan were gonna get basic labs get a head ct and well go back over to the and then go from there anybody have any questions concerns nopes sounds like a plan were gonna 
get a chest and pelvic now ct is ordered what labs do you want just basic trauma ones can you work on the pulse ox as well yea i think its i see its not on her it came off for some reason its not reading again just basic basic 
labs i see basic trauma labs yeah okay you guys want any labs not right now what rays should we want to get for right now any blood work can we get a repeat sugar on him please cause he was excuse me is he a diabetic oh hypoglycemic yeah 
there was they checked the sugar on him of oh so you already have a not just they just checked his sugar oh left arm band we can get a for that purpose i forgot about that you wanna get that from the blood work oh no i was gonna 
check it oh you took a alright that okay rays so far yes and spine i know so well do an stat for sugar and well get lateral spine uh uh rays and well go from there all they did was a ct all they did was a ct no 
drug or allergies from food no vomiting or anything no vomiting all weekend sheds had a cough a cold for 4-5 days we just need search really right yeah and upload the um Tran consult yeah yeah yeah if we can get here we could lab and sale to survey 
so were ready to take this into a room if everyone else is comfortable that kid i was telling you about that depressed skull fracture is here were in the trauma bay right now she looks like iliac there is a sheds in trauma bay right now if we get 
it this time lets just move on to finish the spine and like get out of the room so they can wait for the next trauma staff so a month old with uh unwitnessed trauma who has a palpable right skull fracture with ct confirmed were gonna call surgery get 
basic trauma labs and skeletal survey lab results hers had a a and a bagged urine all of which look fine except for a slightly elevated and alt is his is of urine has no red blood cells thats why such low levels uh you slided spines right and gonna 
get trauma labs yeah so in summary we have a a month old in a um reactor um much no obvious injuries on primary or secondary um were keeping the collar in for now were gonna get a lateral spine we already have negative trauma labs and um so well 
reassess after the thank you ism interested in basic trauma labs from that i did hers getting basic trauma labs and a dose of morphine at handset has been requested uh radiology tested the right knee you need you need you want uh you want blood basic trauma labs please 
yeah basic trauma labs got it okay so once the iv is secured turning the patient to assess and then well figure out what plain films we need likely just get an so we can see see where it is and confirm that its there i think just basics right 
now okay basic trauma labs a can we pull up pull up basic trauma labs alright okay trauma labs have been ordered already thats happening id just do spine and extremity films uh lets start with basic trauma labs so hers gonna need a ct head uh basic trauma labs 
uh probably actually well probably do plain films of the neck uh were gonna do plain films of the neck to clear it do you guys want to put do you change out to do you leave those if if a good fit you leave it but if not i 
mean if happy with it i think i think we can probably clear him after plain films so i think hers gonna be in it for a long time so were gonna get a ct head trauma labs and okay do you need me to hold spine to or do 
you think hers okay uh not you need to hold well just let it hang and then well probably want to get trauma labs and an iv and do basic trauma labs that would be great uh yes well do right femur knee and tibia basic on the left yea 
basic labs basic labs have right um overall primary survey was negative secondary survey was most notable for um significant pain to the right lower extremity uh e and uh leg lower leg and then a small abrasion on his nose so basic trauma labs weave gotten morphines get a 
flu and rays of the right lower extremity you did get labs yeah they were all normal so were gonna go look at the pictures so no labs hers already got labs correct no labs yes no labs we just need to roll him did we do that already yes 
we did on the other side okay so and well check well check the urine for a thats the only lab and well get a pelvis view guys drawing basic trauma labs we need we need a better flask oh it means that were just gonna use a little flask 
over here your blood want to come out of this like this this part so were just gonna were just gonna use a very very thing to get some blood out okay ground reasonable to see a chest is it gonna hurt it will probably feel less than what i 
just did alright ism okay holding off on the chest uh we get chest rays on the grounds of that no obvious injuries on primary secondary survey but given the mechanism and the symptoms well get a head ct and a uh cervical spine anything else anyone can think of 
do you want any labs uh yeah we have basic labs you want basic labs yeah um can we get some blood gas and labs too uh do i wanna get a bedside gas see what you can get and otherwise can i get with a get to a femoral 
stat for blood for a gas if they get it were going to try and get blood for a gas were gonna tears gear up to do a femoral stat to do that um and lets work on getting access well send the uh complete trauma labs complete labs and 
a dose of morphine soon thereafter please so once were done getting the blood well roll her do her back and then lets get a chest cause sheds got a proximal left upper extremity deformity and that could also have a clavicle fracture can you repeat that i heard chest 
what else do you want so sheds got a proximal humerus injury so ism thinking chest with the clavicle which is my indication for the chest and then humerus you want rays of that so rays of bilateral upper extremities which necessary have the clavicle in it and then were 
gonna send full trauma labs and a lateral spine you said full trauma labs yeah is that enough right thats enough right yeah perfect all i need is that enough i got of a more okay sounds good if she did nobody told they order anymore blood works just the 
arm x rays humerus deformed do you want a or just a just arm her hands look fine right hands look fine just the humerus and forearm doing this army so the right upper yeah bilaterally is it easier for you guys to do all the imaging together are they 
gonna shoot all the basic extremities in here or are they gonna bring her to radiology no worries towel towel yup no well get the spine here but thats all okay just the spine start getting access and plan to send basic trauma labs do you want labs for her 
i think we should be okay basic trauma labs how are we doing on labs and access so you said basic trauma labs do you want add anything alright so lets do basic trauma labs and a lateral sequent film tell her they want a lateral spine alright so it 
sounds like we have a previously healthy a month old female now stat is posted vitals are stable um well get access and labs on her well get a lateral spine film and she can go ahead and move out to a room in the main e cat scans have 
been done right yea they had they did a cat scan and a multiple fractures changing table with outside imaging concerning for multiple uh skull fractures and bleed so we gotta upload the imaging review the imaging uh were gonna do a full workup so if he needs labs uh 
the and is low elevated we can repeat it and skeletal survey skeletal survey cap c social work you said labs right um yea so year ill is that just a basic trauma or uh they do a camp coats and uh uh theres gonna be like coats basically its 
gonna be the are you okay i mean green purple and blue you okay okay so coats camp and then the bag were gonna get some basic labs start him on iv fluids get rays of the left uh leg entire leg and wait for the results of the labs 
salines connected uh so well get a ct of the head uh without contrast and then well get plain films of the basic labs were gonna ultra sound his belly were gonna pick you up okay bud well get a chest he does have a little bit of um a 
chest wall tenderness were gonna upload the ct scant and well have our trauma lab depending that will lead us to how hers trending and thats where we are what kind of labs you need basic yeah trauma does it have lasts what stage trauma h and h and um 
hemoglobin and yea thats all i wanted it was hiding his belly do you want any fluids do you need to do any imaging since he lost consciousness id feel safe with a head ct scan so were gonna get some blood work were gonna move to another room were 
gonna get some films of his left forearm and his left knee cause he got squished against the pole buddy well do basic trauma labs did you see the ct not i did not i literally just pulled this stuff out of it what did did she just have a 
head ct thats it head ct showed a a mm depressed yeah i know if we scanned anything else not usually with this age we have to do the neck because not at the risk to get any neck injuries yeah so so that was just neurosurgery so just make 
their way down okay good be great i means he looks pretty vigorous but usually with the depression they like to watch two an hour checks every night at least is that for the pick then yeah pick already knows he looks happy well hers not very happy right now 
but yes let me retract that and say hers appropriately annoyed by the fact that we are messing with him and about to stab him and not letting him eat and about to give him an ivy should i continued if you can continue without getting in her way then 
yeah yeah you need all of the labs did you say basic basic labs okay yeah basic labs thank you it was basic trauma labs well get basic trauma labs nurse if you'll consult get a second read on the head ct gonna upload it um but no labs say 
hospital none do you want basic labs she was so swollen drooling earlier yeah basic yeah its decreased in swelling a lot and secondary for the ct so they come and they brought it they did uploading it now okay so lets take a look at her head ct well 
get basic trauma labs because they get any over there and then i think thats probably it so basic trauma labs is all you need ct saturated ct do you guys want any labs i want labs do you want labs i donate no labs so we know for sure 
well need a lateral spine film well need a ct of his head well need a whatever the comprehensive labs are i think those are standard i have the ready when you guys are whether to get a ct of the face is the only things hers got blood in 
the nose... yeah well were going to head the head so just do the face as well anybody want the results please 730 of 34. chemistries of 39. calcium 1.16. h and h of and 35. base deficit 0.8. glucose lactate 1.3. tell me when you guys are ready for 
the ct yeah were ready for the ct so lets get a spine now then well go over and get a ct of his head his face is stable though right yeah just looks like nasal bridge is swollen lets get a ct of his face then ct face as 
well so we will start with basic trauma labs were gonna get a chest of his shoulder and numerous so imaging of his shoulders his numerous and his chest basic trauma labs and hers gonna get a bolus what are you thinking about for imaging and lab things i have 
my thoughts but i feel like they might want something different do you want them to him now or can we do his leg here do we do the leg now ism fine with that i know what the orders are can we do that yeah just tell him what 
we want so hers having hip pain so we should probably get a pelvis and then he was also complaining of pain the lower leg so a pelvis and a pelvis and tibia sounds good okay alright no you want spine right yes that was part of his... okay pelvis 
and right yes please basic trauma so were getting the basic labs and that sounds good thank you so well also just get a lateral spine okay do you feel like you want to get trauma labs not i think so alright so i think the plan going forward is 
well change her out to j well get an of her chest her right wrist and spine t and ll okay anybody have the say that again cold right wrist and chest and a pelvic okay so we summarize saying she has c t and l tenderness right wrist right 
chest wall and right hip so were going to get rays of t and ll chest right wrist and pelvis what imaging do they have they have a head ct which were getting moved up now i means alright so we just want to hold it until we get an 
i means i just think we need to at least evaluate thats fine and then we can you want a ct not just like a little is fine okay well just hold him till the films okay not were gonna get spine films and see what those look like were 
gonna get the c head loaded and then you want them before you correct and were working with hospital to get that ready the destination is an issue so is he trauma or are we going to find out yeah i want to see the stuff first thought and i 
do want basic trauma labs cause he fell right alright so ism going to look at the scans and well talk to neurosurgery once they look at to see how close monitoring we want overnight but i suspect he should be able to go to the floor hello what are 
our plans for is it clear you are sitting there holding it not gonna hold were not gonna put in the brakes apparently not were not doing an ct were doing a of his neck of is ordering it now not i want rays first alright so yeah change the 
collar thats fine so were gonna get basic trauma labs spine well have dental come and look at the tooth alright so well do a ct head and then well do female NBC straw standing on the side... were going to get a head ct and c spine rays and 
down okay i just need a room for her and i will were gonna need trauma labs comprehensive basic trauma labs comprehensive yeah given the mechanism of injury i think we should his spine as well as his chest and a ct of his head is suction ready suction is 
ready okay go ahead is she clenched down sheds clenched down you ready for your gas results yep um sodium 144. k 3.4. h and h 11.9 and lactate 2.37 full trauma comprehensive trauma labs and then we need basic all the full trauma labs we were but uh its 
stopped right now to get more labs yeah no problem ill get the rest of the blood later we need blood ill do this i gotta get more blood but i canst get it right now can we get a chest were gonna get a quick chest over here to
