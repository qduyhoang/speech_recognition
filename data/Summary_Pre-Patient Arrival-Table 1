speech male fell we think off the back of a moving golf carts lost consciousness on seen hers been responsive to vocal commands and alert told oriented person place things which is having only complaint right now is back and head hurts hers been on the back board for 
about an hour now got some road rash on his knees some abrasions and stuff on his face other than that hers in pretty good shape survey complete vitals been stable whole time we have had him and then was little bit little bit tacky between like a of a 
of and then to p pass of on room air no allergies no and no medical history so there is this is pain on the back of the head but i cannot visualize that right now so when we turn him over ill check on the face there is no 
tenderness on palpation and i see any injury except for the right Nair witch has signs of bleeding as we saw now ill check him now alright were going to conclude our secondary survey at this point so we are getting basic labs were putting in a liter of fluid 
were getting c t head max face bilateral temporal bones anyone have any other concerns at this time i have an eight year old male who was on a bicycle um little safety restraint um no helmet was struck by an SUV uh sir who was driving the SUV said 
he was actually dragged a foot or so he has a very bad abrasion here and also on the thigh um there is open skin at the actual and at the forearms um small pain two out ten on the thigh the right thigh the blood pressure and blood clots 
have not drop at all they remain stable at over eighty over um pulse of open saturation at any at all not no at all he was conscious and alert he understands everything he also has an abrasion next to his mothers arm and landed on his left shoulder and 
arm he got have some minor deformities to his left shoulder he got a small bump on the back of his head no l o c his vitals are beautiful reset of 100 set room air blood pressure a over a over of heart rate right around 200 no medical 
history no allergies i do have mom look at this and left shoulders he does have good movement and color in his left hand this is of month old who was playing second floor of his town home when he pressed on the screen of the window and fell out 
there was a language barrier with grandma standing the mother spoke with her says there was no loss of conscious but he was trying to fall asleep directly after parents state he has been normal the whole time primary should be john lets go on to the secondary survey alright 
well summarize real quick this is a of month old female that took fall second two stories with no loss of consciousness reportedly but no witness even with dynamically stable primary survey is negative secondary survey negative as well he has according to mom has had two days of upper 
respiratory infection has had quite a bit of so in summary of our primary survey airway is patent spine is secured hers got bilateral breath sounds hers got good pulses distally including distally in his left foot of is fine so we can actually probably take the of off for 
now is pupils are normal a centimeter laceration to the left scapula superficial nature has a no active bleeding just a bruised i see any other stab wounds to the back or the the dude has a small abrasion to his left elbow left forearm and left hip alright in 
conclusion primary secondary survey hes got the three centimeter lacerations in the back so swelling in the left eyes force laceration in the lower left extremities we need a comprehensive lab and we need an upright chest yea year so basically his physical exam is normal except the visible laceration 
to the left scapula area four centimeter superficial laceration to the left lower extremity left elbow abrasions and then some swelling to the left eyes he is also allergic to penicillin want to get some or something did you say that there is a superficial on the back on the 
left scapula and the left thigh ems said of on arrival here of 15. his airway intact we were able to cease time we control it able to be cleared clinically normal oxygenation uh pressure and heart rate are completely normal a the of of has remain stable no other 
obvious abnormality on initial assessment in term of secondary only other weave been able to determine at this time buds says he has some bruising at the back of his head and has pain at his left should a out of of no obvious deformity of any kind from there 
we are still going to be looking at his lower extremity and his back but again were comfortable with well start with our basic labs know weave done a recap already but just briefly positive loss of consciousness hitting at the back of head times a against a metal pole 
of of when arrived here of 15. intact not in shock normal vital and the primary surveys unrevealing otherwise remain our secondary survey as mention hello hi sweetheart okay so sheds a years old we got on the scene and saw a kid laying on the concrete we saw a 
kid laying down on the concrete she had some blood on the floor on the ground she know what happen it went out as a pedestrian struck it was a very low speed area so something was wrong we saw a window three floors up we had them investigate there 
was a chair at the bottom of the window the window was open she was conscious crying want us to help her it took a little to console her got her down once we got her on the ground we notice that her right leg is rotated out not if 
it rotated out and there is a little bit of deformity right there left leg left leg i do i did eventually get an iv in the left act of her pressure has been stable the whole time no abdominal rigidity no pain no chest head all intact nothing in 
the head pupils were equal and reactive some blood from the mouth and nose and some blood on the ground appear to be any damage there and sheds been talking to us and everything the whole time throughout has been she does not know what happened and she does not 
know what happen she does not know if she was up stair or down on the ground and she does not have the ability to move her left leg that should be good her vitals were normal all stable she was slightly like around 130 when she saw her mom 
about 150. blood sugar was 140 her airway is patent and protected breathe sounds are cleared bilaterally we have two plus pulses bilaterally lower extremities her cap refill is about a seconds a to of its a on the right its a little delay a on the left so we 
are going to do a summary real quick this is our a year old who likely fell out of a third story window approximately of feet was found without loss of consciousness at the scene normal vitals brought in primary survey is intact including a of 15. on secondary survey 
help me with this because i missed some of the stuff she got dried blood on her hands and nose and a deformity of her left femur thats tender but otherwise no other findings she was also complaining of some mild cervical discomfort some right clavicle discomfort none of these 
have any deformity or obvious zero pain and also some belly pain and her abdomen is a little distended so she is getting a bolus of of per kilo of l r that is already running sheds gotten of for the pain score of a out of we are going 
to get a lateral spine which we can do here and then she is gonna get a pelvic and left femur to rule out a fracture why we add on a two view of the right clavicle i know where n a l is and we have sent basic labs 
that includes and a right so lets just do a summary for he is a of to of year old was hit by a car of miles an hour no vitals stable in the field primary survey intact secondary survey significant for an abrasion and some tenderness over the right 
hip and thigh he should get some morphine cause his pain score was a to a out of of so we could do that he is getting an of a liter through his of he has basic labs that will be sent and then a pelvic in addition to a 
to the right femur and his spine has been clinically cleared alright so vitals are fine not in shock all intact is 15. ill summarize overall here so were here with of minutes in this Angelo hers Angelo of year old male no significant medical history other than his left 
ankle surgery he was standing on a wall fell about of feet no loss of consciousness was of at the scene and both here are all intact from that stand point only obvious injury we can see on secondary survey is hers got abrasion on the right forehead obvious deformity 
a left wrist or distal forearm and hers got some old abrasion maybe on the right knee maybe a fresh one on the left from there in term of we got his c spine immobilized although i think hell be able to clear clinically but well get lateral c spines 
behind films for him and well also get plain films of the left wrist and i think we should get the distal forearms at hand as well just give him the location of it from there well get basic labs and pending all that imaging i think that well attempt 
too see what we can do with the c spine from there of year old football player that had an injury and fell during football today no lock but sleepy and lethargic is i asked them to place a saline lock and immobile his they said alert and oriented but 
sleepy and lethargic so ism a little confuse okay of year old here football practice had a fall no loss of consciousness but is slightly in 14. well reevaluate here our estimated weight is of kilo stats were good vitals were fine good impulses this is hers of year old 
male he was playing kickball on a hard surface he collided with another player head first fell down he was sluggish when he woke up they place a of like 13. hers been at a of of for us remembers the whole incident small through his head other than that 
thats it so basically this is a of year old male with a kickball injury is that right fall during kickballs some initial alter now is 15. you know diagnosis possible concussion hers stable we can just move him to the ed and observe him waiting for his family anybody 
have any other suggestion comments concerns so just so everyone is aware now that we have a full team a year old coming in to transit from an outside hospital her injured cranial bleed fall down a stairs has had a c t head through with a and a possible 
small under brain small has not been intimated at a g c s of of though some concern about the ability to assess of the outside hospital were working on of kilogram weight for a a year old anticipating a minimum now primary and secondary survey and getting the images 
reread and then if the child is looking stable obviously there could be a white until we decide whats there is on top and if its more concerning we can deal with it and at a this morning she was found outside the house and she fell down said about 
a steps which were concrete steps no known loss of consciousness cried immediately dad picked her up put her in the car and started going to the hospital says she fell asleep on the way over so sheds not sure if she truly did loss confess at all but at 
this point reporting no loss of consciousness she when shes asleep verbal pain assimilation wakes her up she responds perfect she wants to be up stretch be in moms arms she has no known history of anything no med no allergies head c t there showed a questionable left notion 
or anything no skull fracture off the chest off of contusion pulmonary contusion says she no no other known restrictions or she has an i v affixed in her right hand she has received no body fluids no medications at the other hospital or transport she has been responding appropriately 
once again in the moms and dads arms guys we are going to summarized so we got a toddler with a concern for an bleed primary survey is unremarkable reassuring g c s given that she is moving her neck we will not put her in a neck splints ism 
sorry cervical collar we will get comprehensive trauma legs actually concern that she has pulmonary contusion possibility in addition to the head we will need to talk to nurse once the c t is uploaded thats happening now i think she has any immediate medication needs and i anticipate transferring 
her to one of our beds going to keep a close eye on her pending the read of the c t Nero search console and then if there is finding on that admission she has an abrasion on her left left side of her back left side back alright well 
summarize real quick this is a of month old female that took fall second two stories with no loss of consciousness reportedly but no witness even with dynamically stable primary survey is negative secondary survey negative as well he has according to mom has had two days of upper respiratory 
infection has had quite a bit of before we move forward can we just someone read off the vitals and then if you have any concern before we move to secondary state them eight twenty one over uh by Dyna map and one ten over by manual uh to summarize 
this is john does unclear age were assuming ten struck while he was riding a scooter by a motor vehicles unclear speed of the vehicles so based on mechanism alone his is thirteen were gonna get a of his head dry were gonna get basic labs hemoglobins and a he 
have any other recognizable deformities besides a small abrasion on his knee and the laceration over the left post of his of year old female hit by a car going about of miles per hour witnesses say there was no loss of consciousness she spoke the entire time patent however 
was repeating questions throughout the ride here asking the same questions over and over again she does have some left leg pain upon movement not upon palpitations sheds got a bunch of abrasion along the right side starting here some on the back of the spine no pain down there 
obviously i v established she does have a contusion to the back of her head shes getting she just started to get a headache just now as we got here peoples pearl the whole time able to speak through the whole ride a out of a times of a except 
for the questioning of where her mother is where her family members where what happened so lets take a moment to summarize of year old pedestrian hit by vehicle about of miles per hours so theoretically stable at this point were going to get rays right shoulder elbow and wrist 
as well as the left femur and then go over for a head c t since she complained of headaches and then spine rays as well and spine as well so was on his bike in a alley and a vehicle struck him on the right side knocked him from 
his bicycle not wearing a helmet but he says he did not loose and his only complaint is to his right leg from ankle to thigh as far as we could tell no deformity he is naturally pigeon toed so both of his feet are turned inward but lung sound 
good pupils good hers moving good air hers alert oriented g c s is 15. so we completed the secondary survey just in summery this is an a year old boy who was hit by a car and was on his bicycle no loss of consciousness most concern is the 
right lower extremity c collar can be cleared i would do it after we get rays going just in case though lets get go ahead and get femur and then lower leg foot just because we canst rule out anything just on the femur well go from there to the 
rear which pushed her car seat up almost all the way into the front seat um she was actually in a perfect little pocket she was pretty well conserved her leg was stuck and it was stuck actually in the plastic right here of the car seat so they did 
have to extricate her sheds been awake and alert the whole time she is obviously getting a little sleepy she has significant laceration coming off the left eyes she also has what look like a possibly broken left jaw it was the left leg that was stuck although she is 
complaining of tenderness in her right elbow and right leg as well okay left is cleared no blood so in summary passenger in a by a bus with significant intrusion she was restrained in her car seat had significant intrusion um primary survey negative secondary survey significant for left eye 
swelling laceration uh swelling at the left jaw left arm tenderness discomfort hard to pin point exactly where it is but i think it from shoulder through left wrist bilateral lower extremities with thighs knees ankles swelling and superficial overlying of laceration and abrasion over bilateral lower extremities so two 
concerns right know if this is a femur fracture it was very stable before and its not now if we could just find a way somebody could just straighten that leg out and wrap it that would be great i only have she seems to be in a position of 
comfort lets just go through labs and surest were gonna have standard labs we are gonna get a head ct based on intrusion of the vehicles were going to get a left upper extremity of the upper army elbow forearm and hand views were going to get a pelvis film 
bilateral femur bilateral bilateral feet uh well get as soon as were able um well give her one dose of morphine pain hers a day old full term infants with no prior medical history about a am today he fell from about counter height on to his kitchen floor parent 
brought him hers got some inner cranial bleeds hers been appropriate behaving per parents except a maybe little sleepy no vomiting hers been in since am this morning hers a saline bolus hers five point five kilograms he slept for us along the way has not been medicated for pain 
he could probably benefit from a little something um thats maintenance fluids d five and a half it two zero so lets summarized this our uh six week male status post fall the and outside ct scant stable with a stable at the outside facilities so were likely gonna transfer 
him for exam well get the basic labs and well get the ct from the outside loaded up by the radiologist and well contact our surgery to see if they want any other additional imaging or procedures a its a of year old male that was in the back of 
a golf car unknown speed fell off of hit his head unknown amount of times initially gave him a g c s of of male fell we think off the back of a moving golf carts lost consciousness on seen hers been responsive to vocal commands and alert told oriented 
person place things which is having only complaint right now is back and head hurts hers been on the back board for about an hour now got some road rash on his knees some abrasions and stuff on his face other than that hers in pretty good shape survey complete 
vitals been stable whole time we have had him and then was little bit little bit tacky between like a of a of and then to p pass of on room air no allergies no and no medical history alright were going to conclude our secondary survey at this point 
so we are getting basic labs were putting in a liter of fluid were getting c t head max face bilateral temporal bones anyone have any other concerns at this time mothers arm and landed on his left shoulder and arm he got have some minor deformities to his left 
shoulder he got a small bump on the back of his head no l o c his vitals are beautiful reset of 100 set room air blood pressure a over a over of heart rate right around 200 no medical history no allergies i do have mom look at this 
and left shoulders he does have good movement and color in his left hand alright so at this point we have a neurologically normal child with a left upper extremity deformity thats the only obvious injury since he got a g c s of of we can probably attempt to 
clear his alright to recap we have a neurologically normal a month old who fell from a height of arms no loss of consciousness primary survey nothing on secondary survey he has a deep deformity of his left upper arm were getting a separate trauma labs as soon as we 
can were getting film of a lateral spine as well as shoulder upper arm and elbow evaluated for the deformity and then at this point were going to observe and see what r n g is coming back well get him on ate fluids anyone have any other thoughts any 
other concerns i have an eight year old male who was on a bicycle um little safety restraint um no helmet was struck by an SUV uh sir who was driving the SUV said he was actually dragged a foot or so he has a very bad abrasion here and 
also on the thigh um there is open skin at the actual and at the forearms um small pain two out ten on the thigh the right thigh the blood pressure and blood clots have not drop at all they remain stable at over eighty over um pulse of open 
saturation at not no at all he was conscious and alert he understands everything he also has an abrasion next to his so what happened yesterday afternoon um the mother was changing the patient and kind of rolled off the changing table no loss of consciousness uh started crying immediately 
alright lets summarize real quick six months old male fell from a table uh changing table changing table with outside imaging concerning for multiple skull fractures and the so we gotta upload the imaging review the imaging uh were gonna do a full workup so he needs an labs alright 
so theres a of year old female she was struck by a vehicle that was traveling approximately of miles an hours vehicle sustained damage to the windshield and front bumpers patient was reportedly found unresponsive unconscious prone on the on the street on our arrival she was she was disoriented 
she was unsure of what had happened with some repetitive questioning now the patient is alert and oriented she has never displayed any unconsciousness or decrease level of consciousness with us vital signs have been remain stable and round she has a of gage in the left ac lungs have 
been cleared stable abdomen soft and contender only noted injuries where some abrasion to the pelvis a above the right eye and some various abrasion on the elbows and face sheds reporting some elbow pain headache still does not recall the incident no medical history besides her manic bipolar depression 
for which she takes no known allergies estimated weight of kilograms got a teenager here struck by a car sheds g c s sheds got multiple aberrations sheds got clear airway in act right now sheds got bilateral breath sounds yes so as i said we got a teenage girl 
struck by a car multiple abrasions contusions to the face predominantly sheds got a broken tooth but airway intact small amount of blood in the airway she is breathing well on her own right now bilateral breath sounds circulation good bilateral pulse sheds following commands g c s is 15. 
ado soft contender i see any signs of to summarize we have a Andy how old she is she looks fairly old so of or 18. you could ask of got hit by a car of miles per hour lost consciousness need a head c t probably the facial trauma 
get a facial c t as well of not usually in aim to output speech do you have any info on the incoming patient yeah so what i know is an of year old boy who was at an ice hockey game got somehow struck in the right wrist the 
concern is he has a very weak pulse and just about cold panic extremities and obvious deformities are we estimating weight at of kilos do we have out o a hooked up yes do we have our suction hooked up yes do we have our trauma shears available this is 
is a of year old hockey player he did score today wood see everybody likes that he was slashed in the right arm initially they said it was very blue and it was it was constricted and concentrated in now he has a a out of of in pain which 
is mostly in the hand not in the arm as much but he still has a slight deformity within the army hers muscular oriented full recall of all events history is otherwise unimpressive no known allergies no medications did have some food and drink today a a of kid was 
playing a hockey game isolated injury on the right mid forearm with there is concern for actual injury there is concern for arterial injury and do you have any medical problems any medicines you take any allergies ever have any operations of year old male playing hockey today was hers 
13. got struck with a hockey sticks he he was just reported as being yes please thank you madam anything else hurt besides your wrist Alene no well my hand and like my fingers just keep breathing keep keep breathing still at an a and a half great so we 
have a four year old who was in an the car seat came unhooked or maybe it was booster and he slammed with the seat in front of him which had an screen the screen is broken and that whole seat is broken apparently they think from the force of 
the child hitting it he had at the scene and has a lot of frontal bruising and and i know what else but is alert and oriented our estimate weight is about seventeen kilograms just to get you up to date with everything were getting a four year old who 
was in an mac sounds like she was restrained but something about those restraints broken so then she hits the seats how is he hers a little tired i know if hers out i think they were one way but doc over there wanted to seen them by car and 
i was like i really feel comfortable i mean that area can cause a bit of stress that was my concern hers four years old we guessed about of kilos dad sure dad is here with us they were in the backseat of a minivans then it struck other vehicle 
in the back he went forward hit the seat on where it has those little screens and uh initially after the accident he was crying and all that stuff and has slowly become sluggish no no history no allergies um that basically it were not positive but theres almost a 
little bit of um that we noticed here coming in what kind of car seat was he in a booster seat ism sorry what was he sitting in booster okay so fourteen year old female collided with another while playing basketball suffered amnesia has and giving here a of thirteen 
stable by ten okay take out the hair oxygen trauma shears and estimated weight is fifty kilos were getting the out of the do you know the age fourteen years old fourteen fifty kilos the head is the only thing were worried about yeah they said possible low consciousness of 
thirteen going to another skull uh collision from a basketball game vital signs were otherwise perform normally okay so this is a fourteen year old female uh collision while playing basketball uh of fourteen initially with some uh amnesia is reporting some tenderness in the thoracic spine were gonna get 
some basic labs get a ct of the head plain field of the so ten year old fell at gymnastics positive l o c now alert fine about a minutes out positive l o c oddly i also know that she fell on a carpeted surface surgical senior is right 
outside so this is a of year old who was at gymnastics fell had loss of consciousness is now alert with a reassuring blood pressure they should be here any minute by helicopter so i anticipate that we will check her mental status if she is alert oriented stable then 
go from there ten year old at gymnastics fell and loss consciousness fell onto a carpeted surface i was like what is the story here like fall from parallel bars or how or uneven bars ten years old she was doing some sort of gymnastics at a friends like birthday 
party in the basement on the carpet slid fell believed she struck her head in some point family or the adult that where there witnessed a loss of consciousness they tried to keep her awake they very successful with that unknown how long the loss of consciousness was but when 
i got to her she was responsive to verbal stimuli she was complaining of head pain kind of everything hurts all over e m s reported that she was which is why they restrained her extra to the board as we were coming down through the elevator she said sheds 
doing fine but her head hurts she will open her eyes sheds got an of gage i v in her left a c no no allergies no history so in summary this is a of year old female who fell while doing gymnastics first loss of consciousness right now presentation 
g c s of of other then that baited airway she has heightened access on the right a c bilateral pulses and no other significant issues and second survey she have any open lacerations or anything so three month old female otherwise history no medicine no allergies shots up to 
date she was playing on the bed when mom and dad were revolved in altercation she rolled of the bed approximately two feet to the floor abrasion to her forehead abrasion to her nose um also allegedly step or kicked on my dad in the belly no obvious injuries belly 
soft good valve sounds otherwise she behaves appropriate vitals signs stable no sorry go ahead summarize this is a three month old baby uh airway was tainted we have an access on the left upper extremity purple pulse on presentation was around thirteen but sheds now fifteen and on the 
secondary survey theres no sign of trauma on any part of the body uh theres no history on the consciousness of the baby no and it was two feet from the bed to the floor is that correct its like about that size of the box so two to three 
feet yeah obviously you had her anything to eat or drink but she been vomiting sheds only breastfed right you breast fed since or you did i breast fed her when i first got the here downstairs did you fall did you fall at all do you remember everything that 
happened i was walking and and they was the boys was talking they just one of the friends passed him the gun and they shot like two times and thats when i ran across the street to the train station and thats how i got shot they hit me and 
my friends told me to lay down i laid down and they wrapped the gun on my leg just to summarized of year old guy shot in the bilateral legs no obvious injuries well get rays of the lower legs and take a look at results speak with the attending 
just to make sure nothing a no labs or anything else of year old male male was in the back of a pickup truck ill show you the pictures in a second unrestrained in the backseat of a pickup truck pickup truck swerved on the bridge hit the barriers dividing 
the highways crash pretty hard ton of damaged this young man was unrestrained in the backseat unknown what he hit but if you look at his forehead what we have covered up is a laceration about a inches to his skull you can see his uh skull unknown been talking 
to me the whole time uh hers obviously getting pretty drowsy complains of pain in lower right quadrants thats his major complaint right now lower right quadrant pain uh backboard and collar out of precautions good in all four extremities whats your name buds all other vitals good any given 
no given run an iv or anything anybody seriously injured in the accident hers the worst okay do you have the pictures yea in just a second thank you this is an uh of year old um that uh was riding a bike fell and hit his head reportedly helmeted 
but the helmet rid upgrade up on his head fell off somehow rid up yeah and he now has a parietal skull fracture with and on that side so my concern is that there is a possible skull fracture uh neurologically intact i believe his weight is of kilos of 
kilos for an of year old like actually i kid you not alright just a quick story since we got the whole quorum here hers an uh of year old kid apparently hers had multiple skull fractures before so hers a rough and tumble kid riding his bike helmeted but 
his helmet rid up onto the top of his head a rode up i know so he fell hit his head no loss of consciousness uh has i believe its the left side and a parietal simple fracture here um so because of the they did a head ct they 
do temporal cuts so theres um and they see a parietal uh simple skull fracture so my guess is that that goes into the temporal bone and thats what um is when did this happen lets say a hours ago uh maybe a or a hours a or of hours 
ago i took the call maybe about an hour and a half ago hello everybody this is of year old and weighs 80.5 kilos today about riding his bicycle run into anything but happened to fall over on the right side uh does not have a loss of consciousness cried 
immediately dad just ran and saw him took him to uh memorial hospital ct there showed that there was let me get this right a right closed parietal and occipital fracture he was also concerned about a basilar skull fracture but give me any reason for that he just felt 
like there probably would be one there theres some uh right um right but you know some soft around that right side no other apparent injuries vitals have been stable for us hers been awake alert and oriented pupils have been poor he fell about of feet onto his face 
face vitals are stable not having any pain anywhere right now checks were good during transport do you know if the event was witnessed uh his dad been working in the parking garage and then he fell onto what um i think it was a table he said i know 
if hit the table or end table or something coffee table coffee table so fell onto a coffee table fell off of a banister onto a coffee table face first primary review primary so for the clear airway clear breath sounds bilateral distal pulses pupils mm reactive um a year 
old male he was a pedestrian struck by a car that we think was going maybe around of miles an hours the driver side mirror was broken off the side of the care bystanders sure whether he went under the vehicle at all although i think any evidence shows that 
he did um he has a contusion to his forehead and he has some swelling to the left ankle other than that i found a totally benign assessment loss of consciousness pupils no loss of consciousness uh he is appropriately crying would not tolerate a watched the explorer all the 
way down here can you get a collar okay otherwise chest is good equal expansion good breath sounds bilaterally abdomen is soft and no rigidity pelvis is stable find anything else on his extremities uh his vitals were fine on the way down here he was actually a little hypertensive 
uh just because he was a little worked up he has a of in the right act i did not give him any fluid boluses because i think he warranted it thats all i got for you guys about what time do you think the accident happened half hour ago 
okay can we get pain alright and this is mom in the back uh all only so the date of birth is uh this is baby hers a a month old full term infants who fell from the report is he fell from a bed onto a uh a carpeted 
floor of a carpet over concrete and perhaps hit a wooden uh arm of a chair on the way down cried immediately no loss of consciousness that was about today he is uh neurologically appropriate hers alert he tracks he moves all his extremities his pupils are equal and reactive 
his spot now soft and flat he does however have a depressed skull fracture uh right temporal frontal temporal with possible underlying leads concerning for artifacts on his ct his immunizations are up to date he has no allergies he had iv access which he has lost his last intact 
was about noon so formula today about noon we put him in a j we have no other assessments or concerns heart rate has been in the respiratory rate in the no other uh skin concerns or evidence of injury and uh his temple is a little cool he was 
uh kinda sitting out in the breeze when we got there his temps was of axillary when we got there have any fluids come out not fortunately no fluids she said no fluids this is of a years old no medical history no drug no known drug allergies she fell 
about of feet she was seated on the edge of the platform of a landed feet first onto a wood chipped area basically in a around some grass you see grass its created into a area uh after landing she first fell backwards onto her back did not strike her 
head did not lose consciousness upon our arrival she was laying on her right side alert and oriented uh and a little distressed complaining of right foot pain palpation of cervical spine the thoracic unremarkable sheds complaining of some pain in her lumbar region no deformity noted no deficits noted 
some to the lateral but sheds complaining of pain mostly in the medial of out of good pulse motor sensation here thats it this is a a year old fell off the bed uh um concerned for neck injury um the foreheads an overhead um they like failed the ct 
and without they gone like do a regular spine and they said they have a collar for the h so were putting a collar on and then transferring him over i think he fell and really moving as much um which is a little bit scary so he has pain 
with range of motion of neck but moving his hands and feet fine it was unwitnessed fall by parents um low bed onto carpet i know buddy and no lock no vomiting a year old fall of the bed um multiple like head neck pain like with holding his head 
up alright they able to get any imaging there they said they did a ct but it was like significant movement and they get a regular spine so to recap for the primary survey hers got an airway intact and equal and bilateral breath sounds and the trachea hers got 
distal pulses times four equal round reactive pupils and a of one point off for verbal so to recap secondary survey has revealed no injuries alright so a year old male fall from a bed of normal no no concern for neck pain so we have an a year old 
boy with add who fell while ice skating his head neurological complaints trouble vision received a dose of to facilitate a ct head that was negative there so um hopefully we hers got a j but if not could we get that ready and then i just checked the uh 
weight hers of kilos yeah he was agitated on arrival and further problems ahead okay is what you can because i know the next step yeah come on this way here so in terms of considerations neurological status well have looking for other mixed injuries and whether theres additional uh 
findings so with the negative ct head alright we have a patient no trauma seen here pal okay hit that power button on that bear hugger please yes this one thank you can we uh can we do a summary alright so secondary survey revealed uh no injuries so ladies 
and gentlemen that of male says he had a gun at his waist accidentally shot himself one time in the scrotum one bullet wound to the right side of the scrotum also had some bleeding uh on the also complained of leg pain let us check it but... no history 
no medical allergies outside of seasonal allergies all vitals are stable alright so recaps uh airways intact got equal bilateral breath sounds trachea got distal pulses x of pupils are equal round and reactive exposed moving on the secondary survey this is a a year old male i believe were

with dad when i will bring him back in ism gonna step out and give this to you we have an la ready his chords are closed yeah he probably has a degree of rigor its really hard to tell yes well place an la heres an la guys this 
is an arrest out of the hospital with prolonged downtime a doses of in the field a doses of here ongoing same on the left yeah okay so team listen theres signs of prolonged downtime hers been dead for awhile so were gonna stop the code theres no signs of 
life and hers warm so i think theres nothing we can do okay guys ism sorry this is a year old female from st uh she was the rear passenger of a car versus tree uh supposedly she was in a car seat but when they found her she was 
on the floor with a cooler on top of her uh the two front passengers were entrapped they were working on them uh they got her out first she was conscious and alert but she did have pain reaction reaction to her right shoulder when touched and theres also a

in the area of the thickness of two millimeters and you said the was on the right or the left yeah so posterior vitals have been good for us acting age appropriate pupils are equal and reactive are flat and soft okay thank you no access alright so primary survey 
airway is intact breath sounds bilaterally stats are right now good distal pulses no evidence of shock alright so the only thing really is that theres that little on the right hemisphere were not wanting the alright can you start to tell us the story okay hold on whats the 
story quiet please quiet please go ahead this young lady a years old she was in the back seat um on the passenger side she had actually unbuckled her seatbelt and mom turned around to try and buckle her back in and hit a trees of miles per hours she 
said of miles per hours i think it was slightly more there was more damage on the drivers side wheels and if you guys wanna see he has a picture it she has no mental history whatsoever no nothing you can see she has a nice on right there and 
she says she broke her tooth and lacerations to her alright so to review the primary survey we have airway intact lungs are clear bilaterally stats are okay so what happened so we were just standing by the car and a car hit her and her mother her mother was 
carrying her she got struck she flew out of her arms alright so lets just to recaps were through the primary survey airway is protected breath sounds are equal circulation no evidence of shock are we ready for report yes go ahead five year old male ran across the street 
was accidentally struck by a car going about of to 30. seems like it was the front bumper that hit his head he glanced off of it it a rollover he run over or anything like that as far as whether or not he lost consciousness some people said yes 
some people said for a minutes some people said not were not sure about that he was screaming running around thrashing we tried to do the backboard things it was doing more harm than good we got the collar on him hers got of of of which has helped out 
a lot hers really calmed down and it seems to have addressed a lot of his pain so vital signs all good and hers a hundred percent on the two liters weave got him on here he is ... hers walking up a little bit ready whats the primary survey 
it was airway is patent breath sounds bilaterally and i felt pulses alright so to recaps primary survey was negative of pupils are of bilaterally on secondary survey hers got a laceration over the left eyebrows and some abrasions on the face and right leg has extreme tenderness upon palpation 
this is a year old male fell approximately of feet from a balcony onto concrete was initially transported by ground with the intent of coming here however extended traffic time and some concern about his status they diverted to pg hospital since hers been with us hers been alert and 
responsive he will follow commands talk much and thats really all weave got right now no obvious injuries heart has been high low alright so recap your primary airway is patent entry is equal bilaterally pulse is intact bilaterally his pupils are a mm reactive bilaterally and his is 13. 
alright lets move on do you want to summarize your secondary sure so he has unique signs of trauma on the head as an abrasion over the left cheeks he has also abrasions over the dorsal foot on the left as well as over the ankle on the right he 
also has a what looks like on the left side of his forehead okay okay so we have a three year old that fell approximately of feet only findings of primary survey of 13. secondary survey findings were just abrasions and a frontal alright a female she was involved in 
a motor vehicle sheds approximately of kilograms we believe she was sitting in the backseat unrestrained ejected vehicle rolled over all during the thats all the information i have about the uh no gross deformities a lot of uh superficial scratches from her head to her toe including her back 
decreased mental status when i first uh made contact with her uh she was responding to um uh stimuli uh was originally around it was high now the two have so we started bagging her once she got down around of breaths per minutes and her was running in the 
sixties alright so quick summary primary survey is of had bilateral breath sounds intubated for of of uh pupils were slow but reactive bilaterally secondary survey is in progress okay were gonna summarize again our next steps you wanna summarize your findings real fast alright so on s secondary survey 
secondary survey uh abrasions over the forehead uh uh she she um yeah sheds seizing now abrasions over the forehead abrasions over the um abdomen as well as a laceration over the anterior abdomen she has a large laceration full thickness on the left uh lateral humerus uh also has 
bilateral abrasions over bilateral knees full range of motion in the bilateral lower and upper extremities unable to assess power abdomen is soft anterior abrasions over the uh okay so female of kilos right intubated we have running she got of normal saline sheds multiple abrasions concern for uh well 
showing signs of triads concern for head injury this is of is a years old he was peering out checking both ways for a car and a car came along and sideswiped him he fell to the ground no loss of consciousness according to everybody on the scene no signs 
of trauma except to his left elbow where you see this abrasion he or anything yeah of miles an hours but we heard he was struck not alright thank you so so he was peering out looking both ways looking for a care car came alongside got him on his 
left side he has an abrasion there he has some markings here both other than that breath sounds were good equal rise and fall other signs were good normal signs of neck braced he was a pedestrian struck he was sideswiped but we get that when they call it a 
pedestrian struck by a car going of miles per hours but he actually peered his head out to look for cars and then one came and swiped him on the side he actually looks really good he just has some abrasions to the left elbow and then hers got a 
little thing on his chest uh he had airway his breath sounds are equal bilaterally good determining pulses times a he had of his pupils alright so quick summary the secondary survey revealed a chronic healing abrasion on the left chest hers got an acute abrasion in the left upper 
and left lower upper army right around the elbow otherwise secondary survey was negative this is sheds a of year old female she was driving an ATV with a full face helmet when she ran into a trees no loss of consciousness sheds only complaining of pain to her head 
and pain to the right leg just above the knee other than that sheds got a of iv established all vital signs have been well within normal limits so a summation of the secondary survey we have tenderness on the left on the left medial aspect of the right knee 
tenderness and a superficial abrasion between the eyebrows otherwise intact full range of motion motor and sensation intact fourteen year old male motor cross accident he was driving uh for like of miles an hours hit a trees was ejected and then his left side struck the trees full protective 
gear the helmet was not damaged of his only complaint initially was pain along his left side apparently he crashed early in the day of thats what this is from thats not from the second crash chest wall is stable hers complaining of pain and tenderness on palpation of his 
sternum other than that no other complaints no medical history no allergies blood sugar was he eaten anything all day so summation of it tenderness on the left lower anterior chest and an abrasion sort of a contusion on the left interior lateral chest and then tenderness over the left 
upper you said left upper right tenderness left upper quadrant tenderness and left upper it was his right side that hit the trees right which side hit the trees left the left side yeah i thought it was the left yeah a fell approximately of feet off of uh jungle 
on the like uh rubber floor matting uh loss of consciousness hers incontinent pupils are equal and reactive theres a lump on his head i find any other injuries healthy kid excuse me ems approximately what time did this happen sir about an hour ago one hours half an hour 
ago alright secondary so just to recap the primary survey we have an intact airway equal breath sounds bilaterally hers sitting on room air we have good distal signals heart rates 140. not in shock of 15. spine you can move on so of much rear passengers airway looks clear 
of of of no no not i asked if theres anybody to give us a story not thats the story theres no more can you ask her if she was restrained or that kinda stuff did you have a seatbelt on you did alright so were gonna turn you and 
were gonna be very careful okay and ism gonna ask you again alright sweetheart ism gonna ask you again if tender i want you to say yes or not okay so recapping we have a of female status post much as a restrained passengers primary survey was negative with a 
of no loss of consciousness at the scene of on arrival secondary survey is positive for abdominal uh tenderness uh and for uh total spine tenderness she also has some bilateral what happened what happened uh dirt bike verses dirt bike helmet questionable lock alright so guys listen ism ism 
the ed attending our priorities are iv access for him for pain control well get him off the board we have a surgical resident gonna do our primary and secondary yes you are absolutely alright so please airway very organized so this is um so hers a a boy who 
is a motocross driver who collided with another driver helmet and no lock we were gonna call it just eyeball it but he had enough significant other things that we made it a trauma state so he just came from the scene of medico hers got a significant um distal 
femur deformity with you know an open corner to it so airway breathing circulation he has good aerations good he is so a motocross headlong with another player no lock but a significant we were just gonna call it at the board but we decided to upgrade it significant amount 
of distal femur is open yeah so our order of things are airways breathing circulation fine good pulses etcetera good everything he needs iv access more pain control hers had a total of of of um and hers gonna get some and then well as soon as we have iv 
pain control and hers stable enough id like to roll him at that point probably should stabilize him with this something to help him get off this board no allergies no medications nothing of kilo kid and hers had nothing hers set to get belly labs right so nothing done 
at another hospital not hers right from the field he has an in a lac theres several things that need to be repaired like the lac to the left elbow but major systems are okay so this is a two that we have no history was in a sandbox tree 
came down and struck the child on the right side obvious on the right side he had no signs of life when we got there uh he did have a heart of intubation tube he went what time did backboards the the red board the red board so summations of

triaged sitting in a wheelchair he proceeded to have a grand seizure he was taken back into the era had a second seizure with a decreasing level of consciousness had a ct showed that a uh temporal fracture with some bleed widen down the dominant to accommodate and suction intubation 
then at when we uh walked in he woke up moving all four extremities and purposely trying to received of milligrams of rock hers continued also on initially was at of per kilo per minutes were up to of per kilo per minute right now and hers still waking up 
so so far just a quick summary we went through the primary survey weave already summarized that has been upgraded to a it right now hers moved all extremities um opens eyes spontaneously verbal we canst assess because hers intubated so the only thing we have right now is blood 
in the left uh ear canal thats it alright this is of is a years old sounds like he was behind car when mom was backing up mom i guess felt the impact got out saw that he was under the car briefly moved the car forward and uh got

dry the attending nurse nurse so did you hear the story so right now we have a eleven year old who fell of feet from a climbing wall unsure if there was lock he was for the events now with a uh of of in the field and here stable 
vital signs on exam we are finding a right forearm fracture or probably deformity tenderness in the pelvis right pelvis and right leg lower extremity and uh otherwise negative exam neurologically hers intact we have a spine in spine collar on he was not tender though over the this is 
he fell down of steps they were carpeted steps it went about a story and a half up um onto some concrete covered and linoleum the older brother came down the stairs left the gate open and then he fell down the older brother saw him fall all the way 
from the top initially when mom got to him he was crying and then he became kind of dazed until right before we got there yeah all you gotta do is remove those head blocks he was initially crying and very upset upon our arrival and then hers become hers 
become very tired and lethargic since then okay a couple places of swelling on the left side of his head ill just summarize real quick we have a a month old that fell down about of steps no obvious injuries 15. hers stable his dad is here he was playing 
basketball it sounds like he went up for like a jump shot or a block or something came down on his left side left head he fell on his left head is that what you say fell on his left head left side of his head left side and back 
do you have any medical history uh no allergies no alright summary we have a of year old playing basketball fell down to his left side sound like he lost consciousness uh and hers presenting with some weakness on his left upper and lower extremities everybody in agreement hi this 
is this is motor vehicle crash his grandfather went next door only significant thing to note is a deformity to the right humerus that the or i mean the on scene secured before i got there but they described it as a deformity he was holding on his own before 
they got then hers alert and oriented history of autism normally has trouble telling his left from his right but when i checked his he was able to tell me what side i was of and all that normally other than that the only other discomfort discomfort he reports is 
the uh backboard is causing a little bit of discomfort other than that the arm is the only thing he is complaining of just some bumps and bruises all over from the crash ready got phone number and all that on here but grandfather went next door this is his 
mom hers pretty chill look how cuter oh my goodness what happened did you fall down did you fall down he fell out the deck was there he fell out of the third floor window and the decks on the second floor can you show her where the restroom is 
you wanna give us a report yup so as i said thirteen yes of was in with dad and mom and they were on the third floor bedroom and he was next to the window and he broke out the window through the screen and out the window but theres 
a second floor deck so that helped with that we have a skull fracture alright so to recaps primary survey was clear secondary survey just a over the right forehead so uh he was uh doing on a and a car approached and he lost control of the uh motorcycle 
and fell off he uh witnesses on the scene said he was knocked unconscious from the fall and then when ems arrived we used like a sternal rub and it was difficult to get him awake and hers been hers been combative his uh pupils were dilated and a little 
slow to react do we know if he fell on concrete or on like dirty he was riding a motorcycle and he went to turn around and he skidded and not sure if he hit his head or anything but it would've probably been on concrete and then a car 
bumped him in the head the car bumped they said the car had no injury there was nothing on the care but he was in the street you wanna do the quick summary quick summary of injuries okay primary survey negative guys quiet were having a summary survey so ism 
gonna say at this point with his hers opening his eyes to pain of hers using oriented words of but hers also only localizing pain of so of of of so 12. our primary survey is negative our pupils are dilated but equal and reactive our secondary survey is positive 
for possible left occipital pain possible clavicle well not he has an abrasion to the right hip left flank left thigh left lower leg and right medial knee and right posterior calf and right elbow but full range of motion of all extremities with no tenderness or obvious deformity so 
basic trauma labs of of a kilos of a new drug needs of weeks since conception mom had fallen so they did an emergency section but other than that sheds been healthy she was ... okay you canst be louder than me she was getting a diaper change from the 
bed today fell a feet from the bed to a rug over a hardwood floor mom said initially she picked him up and he kinda was stunned he never like seemingly lost consciousness or anything but looked kinda stunned and then started crying then acted appropriate afterwards so she watched 
him for a while noticed the bruising and so she she uh um then brought him in but she said no vomiting or anything like that but he does have bruising to the right side of the head fontanels are um flat soft of in the right foot did not 
receive fluids or anything so initially before the ct though he was nursed at theres been no vomiting or anything after that that was documented or recorded pupils are both reactive but see both of them at the same time to tell you if they were equal they were equal 
when he the one time he opened his eyes get them to react but did look at them and they did appear to be equal in size and our primary survey is negative secondary survey is positive for left scalp swelling so just to review contusions on the right side 
is that correct ism ah pretty sure its on the left posterior scalp i see anything on the right not so just to review for everyone this is a of fall uh from the changing table transfer from with imaging consistent with a hemorrhage a left bleed and a left 
uh parietal skull fracture primary survey is negative we have a of of at this point uh with a of of of with a left parietal skull fracture uh could we get a repeat blood pressure please it looks like our last one was 138 over 115. our pulse is 
180 and hers sitting well so this is hers a a male hers been nonverbal for me he does respond to painful stimuli he will moan i know somebody was concerned in my initial report to you that he does have but it does it is irregular it will go 
up in the eighties comes back down stimulate him with a pain response heart rate goes up hers sitting not getting him to open his jaw uh believe he was our responders state that when they got there he was not restrained it was a frontal front right much significant 
damage to an SUV do believe the face was struck does have facial trauma the rest of my trauma assessment was normal for him hers uh mom gives a weight somewhere in the eighties so i went with of kilos and like i said a a for me no purposeful 
movement does um flex for painful stimuli do you know what time it happened about almost almost an hour ago at this point took us a while alright so well summarize the primary survey and then move on so airways intact we have equal breath sounds bilaterally we have good 
sat right now he has good distal pulses systolic is heart rate in the we have a of a or a at best and pupils are equal and reactive bilaterally so we can move onto secondary survey hello this is of he prefers to be called around of tonight he 
fell out of a second story window he went the screen went he went down the dad went out immediately he was crying he was crying the whole way to the hospital has not lost any consciousness does has had some vomiting about a episodes okay since he went to 
the hospital has been alert age appropriate no waxing no waning had head ct ct as well as spine ct all of which were read as negative okay a of hip pelvis and chest were done all with as well the of in his right act you see the normal 
saline 250 and he did get as well for the vomiting but he omitted after that as well his blood pressure his vitals have been vitals are pretty stable yup we have the images we do right here ill give it to these guys out here hey guys this is 
a well go with of kilos report is that he was outside playing was sideswiped by a vehicles got a mirror to the face mom found him uh change in mental status outside she picked him up and him to uh of when he got there he was restless irritable 
and combative they went ahead an intubated him and did a head ct from my point of view see anything moving on the head ct intubated for his change of mental status and to protect his airway weave had no issues weave given him a couple doses of midas and 
the last one about of minutes ago and doing well hoping that hell pull through thank you alright so to recap hers airways intubated he has bilateral breath sounds hers got bilateral pulses on the lower extremities he has a of he just got some so i anticipate that will 
changes and then his pupils are through the a sluggish bilaterally i wanna change out his to our on the monitor great alright so do you wanna recaps alright so to recaps airway is intubated clear bilaterally circulations intact hers a of it at the time of evaluation he has 
pupils that were a to a sluggish bilaterally hers got um blood in the right ear canal as well as a a cm laceration under the right hers got a small a cm bridge under the left eyebrows and hers otherwise this is a of year old male pedestrian struck 
by vehicles unknown speed positive on scene history of depression do you know what time he was struck i do not it was earlier this evening right now neck pain a and left leg pain you want to yeah a summation summation primary survey is negative secondary survey significant for 
several abrasion across rue the back the forehead or the left region occipital scalp most importantly theres spine tenderness in the can region i do not appreciate any step offs other small abrasions to the left lower extremity and some tenderness there this is sheds a guesstimating a five kilo 
weight parents said a 6.8 kilo weight was involved in a motor vehicle collision boned on her side restrained yes in a car seat intrusion on her side came in unresponsive the doctor there intubated her 3-5 et tube at of at the lips tube is place fixed and dilated 
pupils for them and for us no medications at all have been given she got a normal saline bolus of all of 100 ml in her right tibial ion thats it for us very in the seventies blood pressure 103 over 64. stats are sheds on of over a with 
a rate of of and of okay you guys wanna move her over yeah ism trying sorry sheds just on the backboards sheds connected on the backboards connected so i know we were unable to get a rectal temperature we tried three different thermometers sheds warm to the touch thought 
they immobilized her neck we canst see any obvious injuries alright so guys to summarized its a a two month old much that that came in with pupils fixed and dilated was intubated in an outside hospital still our biggest concern is for hemorrhage so were preparing to go to 
ct after we finish the secondary survey and get the of monster
