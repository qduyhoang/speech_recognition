were actually probably going to be able to clear him so well we need a c spine reassess his c spine when you roll him back to neutral even though he says of of he is definitely not i would maybe take a point off his eyes are coming in 
and out so i clear his personally even if he is and where you like me to take off yeah they were worried he really like of so they want to clear it whats your is 15. the is fifteen is he opening his eyes yeah hers crying but thats 
four hers crying hers a four and hers moving all so six so fourteen did you do the coma scale scan though earlier in pupils and the scale is behind you on the cabinet is she opening to is she is she open are her eyes open now yeah sheds 
responding and her verbal response is what so what would you rate so what was eyes so she would be a of of she spontaneously open her eyes talking to me and sheds localizing the pain following commands so localizing the pain that would be a of only before during 
speech pump the breaks so g c s and pupil size pupil size is did you pass out or anything just hit the arm not a hard hit that stun you or anything for a second how old yeah alright well see you later any loss of consciousness in the 
scene yes okay hers been awake and talking no non verbal so hers not responding to sternal rub were not getting any response okay so whats his lets see of four for four for eyes one for verbal and ism not getting any response for motor so one for motor 
but let me try again so probably six as of right now six okay hers moving a little bit hers moving a little bit so seven i would say four for pain so a is his eye opening or not eyes open well spontaneous spontaneous is that a bold yes 
or not no theres nothing for verbal and motor to pain motor hers kind of withdrawing a little bit seven we have of seven so you got a of seven what you get i got four one five then if we do pain then thats a nine if we do 
it just to none then thats were somewhere in between there okay thats fine uh his is like somewhere between a seven and nine not really responsive were gonna intubate him but the kid was in a motor vehicle accident uh coming in with loss of consciousness uh declining motor 
so concern for head injury the only thing we have not done actually is for us is we have not woke him to double check what his motion is uh she got a little bit of retrograde amnesia sheds not answering question appropriately sheds uh a little bit combative four 
four yeah well whats your name hey there can i get your name can i get your name did you remember your name do you know where you are do you know what happened why are you here can you squeeze my hands mo mo go through each thing of

on the right a c bilateral pulses and no other significant issues and second survey she have any open lacerations or anything so she has a of thirteen sheds hardly moving her eyes uh she is crying uh she moving uh uh without any spontaneous movement um so motor six 
sheds right sheds got spontaneous movement yes uh verbal would be four and i think sheds only she not opening her okay well just re we can give her thirteen for now three for eyes three for eyes four for verbal and six for yes we do thirty six four 
six for movement yes of fifteen down now this is a three month old baby uh airway was tainted we have an access on the left upper extremity purple pulse on presentation was around thirteen but sheds now fifteen so it a of oh so we got basic trauma ready
