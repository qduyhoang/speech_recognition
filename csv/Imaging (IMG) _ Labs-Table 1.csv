,0:26:03,Yeah well the head C T is going to have what’s called temporal cuts so they cut closer around the bones where they keep the blood in the temporal ahh cause if you do two wide you might miss a fracture so they have to be very fine cuts.,Before,,,

,0:26:39,Uh No I would leave him in for now just because of distracting injury and we're giving him the morphine. I'll leave it in the collar. I would scan his head just based on the mechanism,Before,,,
,0:26:53,"Yeah Um I wanna get a chest x-ray just to make sure there's no other fracture there. Just purely based on mechanism, but um we can get a film of his right thigh to make sure he doesn't have any femur fracture there.

,0:27:32,No arm just to make sure he didn't?,Before,,,

,0:40:07,"So I just spoke to. I just spoke to ortho um we're gonna do the joint and the forearm x-ray. That's what they're requesting, but they say if it's purely soft tissues and there's no fracture joint involvement. Which I don't think is the case, I think it's purely soft tissues, then to call plastics.",Before,,,
,0:40:30,"He doesn’t think that, if it's nothing that's causable at the bedside. He said it'll be something like specialty specific either ortho or plastics, regarding the location. High [realstate?] muscle, soft tissue, bone exposure. So we'll call plastics, after ortho is done. I can even call them now and tell them that's gonna be the plan",Before,,,
,0:42:01,"Yeah so this this, CT, x-rays…",Before,,,
,0:42:26,Six point six on the calcium okay,Before,,,

We'll get basic trama labs and pending all that imaging, I think that  we'll attempt too see what we can do with the C spine, from there",,,,
170,(0:15:54),So we'll get his C-spine here and then move him to his room,,,,

233,(0:21:17 ),"We're just gonna do an X-ray of his jaw, just to make sure there's no fracture there. Probably just a bruise from [housing?] his mouth and everything. Then giving him some Motrin for pain and we'll let him slowly drink and that'll be that.",,,,

175,(0:16:05),A lateral like C-spine or neck?,,,,
176,(0:16:05),Neck just cause he's gonna be hard to assess you know,,,,
179,(0:16:15),Lateral neck is fine,,,,
180,(0:16:21),"We're not doing CT of the neck, just the head, but lateral neck",,,,

285,(0:32:42),"Ok so I have her shoulders down can, we go or no?",,,,
286,(0:33:06),I don’t know how much we can get down but.,,,,
287,(0:33:09),Her shoulders are quite high.,,,,
288,(0:33:24),Yeah her shoulders are still in the way I can’t even see t 1.,,,,
289,(0:33:27),How far down do you want to see though?,,,,
290,(0:33:29),I need I need I need to see we need to see all the separate separate spine I cannot see the last 4.,,,,
291,(0:33:39),We can try one more time if you want but other than that I think we're just going to accept that it’s.,,,,
292,(0:33:44),Can we just try one more?,,,,
293,(0:37:04),Are we going to do the other x-rays after C T or they.,,,,
294,(0:38:03),Ahh we gonna be doing the x-ray like the other x-rays in the room cause this bed is so small.,,,,
,,,,,,
160654,,,,,,
77,(0:06:02),I don’t think so just going to get me a lab he had pain in the legs so might need an x-ray.,,,,
163,(0:13:56),Ahh yes cause I think it only needs one person to go to x-ray so yes.,,,,
172,(0:15:06),I’m going to call for that right now and so he was on his bike car comes up unknown speed umm knocks him off of his bike he umm wasn’t wearing a helmet but clearly remembers he did not lose consciousness. And his primary complaint has been basicly foot to about thigh pain tenderness a lot no obvious deformities but tenders a lot when you touch right at his knee anywhere [tippet] so we’re going to make sure he does not distal femur or lower so those will have the x-rays and he just got morphine 2 milligrams with a weight of 25 kilos.,,,,
173,(0:15:40),And how about the right hip femur and below?,,,,
174,(0:15:43),Just just femur and below.,,,,
175,(0:15:46),Gotcha.,,,,
176,(0:15:46),Like pelvis is stable so I think we are ok on that thought.,,,,
183,(0:16:10),And I am going to call for a room right now while he goes to x-ray.,,,,
188,(0:17:05),X-rays ready for you.,,,,
194,(0:18:36),He’s going to another room for the x-ray.,,,,
195,(0:18:41),An x-ray is ready.,,,,
197,(0:19:07),Ok i’m not sure what you talking about that that’s ok we're getting ready to go someplace else and move on to an x-ray table so it will all be different in a sec.,,,,
,,,,,,
160723,,,,,,
160,(0:22:20),I'm sorry I didn't get all of those X-rays. I was trying to keep up with you,,,,
161,(0:22:24),"X-rays yeah so pelvis, bilateral femur, bilateral knees, bilateral tib fib, bilateral lower legs. For the left upper extremity uh humorous, elbows, radial ulna and ",,,,
222,(0:30:19),"She's not letting me get like a perfectly thorough neural exam, but maybe we'll just see what's going on with the X-rays and then I'll come back",,,,
226,(0:30:41),So are you okay if with transfer her to x-ray this way or do you want some type of immobilization?,,,,
252,(0:32:37),We're x-raying here?,,,,
258,(0:33:20),So I'm go to give the morphine after the X-ray,,,,
264,(0:33:36),Right but if she needs it while she's being manipulated in the x-ray,,,,
327,(0:42:09),And that ortho clear her that she be on position of comfort. She on the right right now. No […] until we decide when we have an idea of what we're dealing with based on x-rays,,,,
328,(0:42:24),So the only x-ray you've gotten so far is that neck or is it the chest?,,,,
367,(0:46:05),"Good so she's moving these well. Something I'm worried about is possibly something here cause she kind of keeps her arm on, so we're gonna get an x-ray. This one doesn't seem as bad. She's moving this a little bit more, it doesn't really bother her. I don't want to move that around just in case something is bad, i don't want her to get hurt.",,,,
374,(0:46:40),"So I don't think, she was holding […] sorry, just because of sort of the bruising here we're gonna get x-rays for all of her lower extremity. But I'm a little bit less worried about this one than this one and she's complaing of a little bit more pain in this one",,,,
396,(0:47:55),We're gonna get x-rays here,,,,
401,(0:48:17),"Um and you know we're gonna get the x-rays, so I can't tell you anything definetly for know, but we'll just kind of take a look and see what's going on",,,,

162,(0:24:05),"So he's gonna get a X-ray on that arm? Yes, no?",,,,
163,(0:24:07),"Um I don’t think so, I don’t think he needs an x-ray. So what we're gonna do…",,,,
167,(0:24:28),"Yeah Um I wanna get a chest x-ray just to make sure there's no other fracture there. Just purely based on mechanism, but um we can get a film of his right thigh to make sure he doesn't have any femur fracture there. Um and then we'll do a basic set of trauma labs and uh wound pair and we'll talk to",,,,
177,(0:25:20),"Right femur, chest x-ray, and basic trauma labs",,,,

0:23:06,C spine with basic trauma labs,,,,,
,,,,,,
0:23:22,There is no need for a chest X ray. Ok.,,,,,
0:23:25,Do you want to do the film here?,,,,,
0:25:14,"So mom we will be taking the X ray in a moment so we will have you step back around the corner there and then you can come right back, ok?",,,,,
0:25:21,"Common buddy, this is your collar you, you look good in this, me I couldn't do it.",,,,,
,,,,,,

0:12:46,"Here's the CT, I'm going to give this to you in case you want to fill it out",,,,,
,,,,,,
0:16:27,"You don't need lateral, you're not too concern about it, but lateral x-rays",,,,,
0:16:34,"No we do not have too. We can watch him move, we can see him turn, him demonstrate his hand stability",,,,,
,,,,,,
0:20:56,So we want poly basic trauma labs?,,,,,
,,,,,,
160746,,,,,,
0:23:40,Forget palpate for tenderness let’s just put it on minor [imaged] for now we’ll get a lateral C spine.,,,,,
,,,,,,
0:24:41,"Alright we’re going to conclude our secondary survey at this point. So we are getting basic labs were putting in 1 liter of fluid, were getting C T head, max face bilateral temporal bones. Umm anyone have any other concerns at this time?",,,,,
,,,,,,
0:25:38,You want to do the lateral C spine here or yeah?,,,,,
0:25:56,"C spine chest, or the x ray?",,,,,
0:26:00,C T of the max and face.,,,,,
0:26:03,Yeah well the head C T is going to have what’s called temporal cuts so they cut closer around the bones where they keep the blood in the temporal ahh cause if you do two wide you might miss a fracture so they have to be very fine cuts.,,,,,
0:26:15,And what is it called? Ahh a temporal bone C T.,,,,,
,,,,,,
0:28:59,Alright are you ready to do the X ray?,,,,,
,,,,,,
160814,,,,,,
0:27:34,So you want basic trauma labs?,,,,,
0:27:36,Yeah we’ll get a basic set.,,,,,
0:27:37,"Ok as far as um, umm, x-rays concerned what do you want?",,,,,
0:27:41,Ahh so I’m going to want left clavicle upper arm elbow.,,,,,
0:27:46,Left clavicle you want elbow?,,,,,

0:31:50,So as we get the labs and give him some pain medicine that’s about it.,,,,,
0:32:02,Just a basic labs..,,,,,
0:32:05,Ahh lateral C-spine umm left clavicle upper arm elbow.,,,,,
,,,,,,
0:32:49,I can get away with 2.,,,,,
,,,,,,
0:34:02,X-rays first.,,,,,
0:34:03,"Oh we're doing x-ray now ok nevermind, we’ll do x-rays then let you come up.",,,,,
,,,,,,
0:34:28,Just gonna pull the arms.,,,,,
0:34:35,I want to ask him how to put it in.,,,,,
0:34:48,K putting in the clavicle the only thing I’m getting when I type it in is clavicle H [...].,,,,,
0:35:05,Could you put that one in put it under her?,,,,,
0:35:08,Yeah clavicle [...].,,,,,
0:36:24,"Umm, it's going to 38. Ok.",,,,,
0:36:27,I think 1 90.,,,,,
0:36:58,Do do the whole x-rays here or no?,,,,,
0:41:39,Forearm?,,,,,
0:42:17,Only other injury is a contusion to the back of the head but we’re not going to C T we’re just gonna monitor it. Umm and it looked like ahh.,,,,,
0:42:29,I I missed that part where they contusion in the back objectile area?,,,,,
,,,,,,
160819,,,,,,
0:26:30,"So he's gonna get a X-ray on that arm? Yes, no?",,,,,
0:26:32,"Um I don’t think so, I don’t think he needs an x-ray. So what we're gonna do…",,,,,
0:26:39,Uh No I would leave him in for now just because of distracting injury and we're giving him the morphine. I'll leave it in the collar. I would scan his head just based on the mechanism,,,,,
0:26:53,"Yeah Um I wanna get a chest x-ray just to make sure there's no other fracture there. Just purely based on mechanism, but um we can get a film of his right thigh to make sure he doesn't have any femur fracture there. Um and then we'll do a basic set of trauma labs and uh wound pair and we'll talk to",,,,,
,,,,,,
0:27:32,No arm just to make sure he didn't?,,,,,
0:27:34,It's not because he has full function of his arm,,,,,
0:27:39,Yeah we'll get him off the board,,,,,
0:27:45,"Right femur, chest x-ray, and basic trauma labs",,,,,
,,,,,,
0:28:01,"Then what we're gonna do after log rolling is replace the collar, though we're not gonna get a film of the C-spine",,,,,
0:28:08,"Oh we can do yeah, no we'll do lateral C-spine and then we'll take him to, we'll go to CT first and then we can do lateral spine, chest x-ray",,,,,
0:28:18,"Right thigh, we'll do right arm as well and then uh and then basically plus or minus OR for wash up",,,,,
0:28:28,"Okay so to repeat basic trauma labs, chest x-ray, right thigh x-ray, C-spine x-ray, CT scan head, right arm x-ray. Thank you",,,,,
0:28:45,Let's just do a quick log roll,,,,,
0:28:58,"Log roll, back down, switch out collar. Then lateral C-spine, chest […] do",,,,,
,,,,,,
0:34:01,Okay we ready for x-rays?,,,,,
,,,,,,
0:34:38,Who's gonna do the arms? For the c-spine x-ray,,,,,
0:35:03,I couldn't tell if you were having a seizure,,,,,
0:37:03,Is x-ray ready?,,,,,
0:40:07,"So I just spoke to. I just spoke to ortho um we're gonna do the joint and the forearm x-ray. That's what they're requesting, but they say if it's purely soft tissues and there's no fracture joint involvement. Which I don't think is the case, I think it's purely soft tissues, then to call plastics.",,,,,
0:40:30,"He doesn’t think that, if it's nothing that's causable at the bedside. He said it'll be something like specialty specific either ortho or plastics, regarding the location. High [realstate?] muscle, soft tissue, bone exposure. So we'll call plastics, after ortho is done. I can even call them now and tell them that's gonna be the plan",,,,,
0:42:01,"Yeah so this this, CT, x-rays…",,,,,
0:42:26,Six point six on the calcium okay,,,,,
0:45:12,X ray,,,,,
0:46:03,We have to put the plate under him for his chest,,,,,
0:46:43,You're gonna roll him towards me and put the plates on that side?,,,,,
0:48:28,Seventy-two,,,,,
0:49:32,"They said it was forearm elbow. So make sure its forearm, elbow ",,,,,
0:50:05,They want to do the elbow and the forearm and then the femur for x-ray and the CT head,,,,,
0:50:55,It's over seventy-three and yep,,,,,
0:51:50,So we're gonna have additional x-rays on his arms and legs. We're gonna do that,,,,,

,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170435,,,,,,

101,0:09:33,Only findings on primary and secondary survey was the scalp hemotoma correct?,,,,
102,0:09:37,Left parietal.,,,,
103,0:09:38,"Left parietal, alright, so we're gonna upload the CT head, uh we're gonna do skeletal survey, and we'll do an AT labs.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170210,,,,,,
156,0:10:34,What labs at radiology do you want?,,,,
161,0:10:49,"I agree, I'm comfortable without any labs or any imaging.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170209,,,,,,
3,0:10:27,"Went ahead and did some various labs, ASP, ALT were elevated so they did a CT belly",,,,
4,0:10:31,Which showed a grade point liver lac,,,,
,,,,,,
6,0:10:40,"Um initially there was a single point drop in hemoglobin, hours 2 and hour 3 were stable",,,,
17,0:11:09,"And there's 4 hemoglobins that you have in total, or 3",,,,
19,0:11:11,Probably in 3,,,,
20,0:11:12,3,,,,
,,,,,,
147,0:16:39,"I think he's stable to go to the floor, just based on the labs we got before, but we'll repeat the set here, just the basic trauma labs and then just monitor him",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170203,,,,,,
109,0:18:08,You need trauma labs done on him?,,,,
110,0:18:10,We're getting basic labs. Thank you.,,,,
,,,,,,
125,0:19:17,"So the plan we're gonna get basic labs, get a head CT, and we'll go back over to the GDR and then go from there. Anybody have any questions, concerns?",,,,
126,0:19:25,"Nope, sounds like a plan.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170128,,,,,,
82,0:23:24,We're gonna get a chest X-ray and pelvic X-ray now,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170121,,,,,,
61,0:26:35,CT is ordered.,,,,
,,,,,,
90,0:28:37,What labs do you want,,,,
92,0:28:39,"Um, just basic trauma ones.",,,,
,,,,,,
134,0:31:35,Can you work on the pulse ox as well,,,,
135,0:31:36,"Yea I think it's, I don't see, it's not on her, it came off",,,,
136,0:31:27,For some reason it's not reading again,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170120,,,,,,
98,0:21:30,"Just basic, basic labs",,,,
99,0:21:32,I see,,,,
101,0:21:34,Basic trauma labs?,,,,
102,0:21:34,Yeah,,,,
103,0:21:35,Okay,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170114,,,,,,
118,0:04:21,You guys want any labs,,,,
120,0:04:23,Not right now,,,,
,,,,,,
204,0:07:57,What X-rays should we want to get,,,,
205,0:07:58,"C-spine, for right now",,,,
206,0:07:59,"C-spine, any blood work",,,,
218,0:08:43,Can we get a repeat sugar on him pelase cause he was hypoglycem-,,,,
219,0:08:46,"Excuse me, is he a diabetic, oh, hypoglycemic",,,,
220,0:08:48,"Yeah there was um, they checked the sugar on him",,,,
221,0:08:50,62,,,,
223,0:08:53,Oh so you already have a bfp,,,,
224,0:08:55,"No, just they just checked his sugar",,,,
225,0:08:57,Oh,,,,
226,0:09:01,Left arm band,,,,
227,0:09:01,"We can get a bfp for that purpose I forgot about that, you wanna get that from the blood work",,,,
228,0:09:05,Oh no I was gonna check it,,,,
229,0:09:07,"Oh you took a, alright that, okay",,,,
230,0:09:18,"X-rays so far yes and spine, I don't know",,,,
,,,,,,
239,0:09:43,"So, we'll do an ISTAT for sugar and we'll get lateral C-spine uh uh X-rays and we'll go from there",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170112,,,,,,
30,0:09:32,All they did was a CT?,,,,
31,0:09:33,All they did was a CT,,,,
,,,,,,
96,0:16:15,No drug or allergies from food,,,,
97,0:16:16,No vomiting or anything,,,,
98,0:16:17,"No vomiting all weekend, she's had a cough, a cold, for 4-5 days",,,,
99,0:16:37,We just need neuro search really right,,,,
100,0:16:38,Yeah,,,,
101,0:16:38,And upload the um neuro tran consult,,,,
102,0:16:40,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, if we can get here we could",,,,
103,0:16:41,Lab and sale to survey,,,,
104,0:16:45,So we're ready to take this into a room if everyone else is comfortable,,,,
,,,,,,
113,0:19:30,"That kid I was telling you about that depressed skull fracture is here, we're in the trauma bay right now, she looks like illiac, there is a",,,,
114,0:19:57,She's in trauma bay right now,,,,
115,0:20:12,"If we don’t get it this time, let's just move on to finish the spine and like get out of the room so they can wait for the next trauma staff",,,,
126,0:21:25,So 8 month old with uh unwitnessed trauma who has a palpable right skull fracture with CT confirmed,,,,
127,0:21:32,"We're gonna call neuro surgery, get basic trauma labs, and skeletal survey",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170110,,,,,,
8,0:00:21,"Lab results, he's had a CVC, a STE-MP, and a bagged urine, all of which look fine except for a slightly elevated AST and ALT",,,,
9,0:00:31,"AST is 59, his AST--ALT is 52",,,,
10,0:00:43,"Urine has no red blood cells, that's why, they're such low levels",,,,
,,,,,,
140,0:09:17,"Uh you slided C-spines right, and gonna get trauma labs",,,,
142,0:09:29,"Yeah so in summary we have a 7 month old in a um rear-or backseat-restrained um MVC, no obvious injuries on primary or secondary, um we're keeping the C-collar in for now, we're gonna get a lateral C-spine X-ray, we already have negative trauma labs and UA, um so we'll reassess after the X-ray",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161227,,,,,,
72,0:04:59,"Thank you, --, I'm interested in basic trauma labs from that",,,,
73,0:05:02,I did,,,,
,,,,,,
79,0:05:24,He's getting basic trauma labs and a dose of morphine at handset has been requested,,,,
81,0:05:32,Uh radiology tested the right knee,,,,
,,,,,,
103,0:06:37,"You need, you need, you want uh, you want blood",,,,
104,0:06:42,Basic trauma labs please yeah,,,,
105,0:06:43,Basic trauma labs got it,,,,
,,,,,,
128,0:08:15,"Okay so once the IV is secured, turning the patient to assess, and then we'll figure out what plain films we need",,,,
,,,,,,
152,0:10:50,"Likely, just get an X-ray so we can see, see where it is, and confirm that it's there",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170105,,,,,,
149,0:06:50,I think just basics right now,,,,
150,0:06:51,Okay,,,,
151,0:06:52,"Basic trauma labs, a UA",,,,
152,0:06:54,"Can we pull up, pull up basic trauma labs",,,,
153,0:06:55,"Alright, okay",,,,
156,0:06:56,Trauma labs have been ordered already,,,,
157,0:06:57,That's happening,,,,
,,,,,,
268,0:11:26,I'd just do C-spine and extremity films,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161220,,,,,,
27,0:07:45,"Uh, let's start with basic trauma labs.",,,,
,,,,,,
73,0:10:50,"Um, so, he's gonna need a CT head, uh, basic trauma labs, uh probably, actually we'll probably do plain films of the neck.",,,,
77,0:11:06,"Uh we're gonna do plain films of the neck to clear it, do you guys want to put -do you change out to Miami-J's-or do you leave those?",,,,
79,0:11:13,"If that's, if a good fit, you leave it. But, if not.",,,,
80,0:11:16,"I mean if you're happy with it, I think, I think we can probably clear him after plain films, so I don't think he's gonna be in it for a long time.",,,,
,,,,,,
142,0:15:02,"So we're gonna get a CT head, trauma labs.",,,,
143,0:15:11,And C-spine. Okay.,,,,
144,0:15:17,Do you need me to hold C-spine to X-ray or do you think he's okay,,,,
145,0:15:18,"Uh, no, you don't need to hold C-spine. We'll just let it hang.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161219,,,,,,
46,0:03:07,And then we'll probably want to get trauma labs and an IV,,,,
,,,,,,
64,0:04:33,"And do basic trauma labs, that would be great",,,,
,,,,,,
111,0:09:04,X-rays?,,,,
112,0:09:05,"Uh yes we'll do right femur, knee, and tibfib",,,,
,,,,,,
116,0:09:16,"Basic, on the left",,,,
117,0:09:17,Yea basic labs,,,,
119,0:09:23,"Basic labs have ATA, LTA right",,,,
,,,,,,
139,0:10:40,"Um overall primary survey was negative, secondary survey was most notable for um significant pain to the right lower extremity, uh E and uh leg lower leg, and then a small abrasion on his nose so basic trauma labs we've gotten, morphine, didn't get a flu ebolas, and X-rays of the right lower extremity",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161217,,,,,,
133,0:52:49,You did get labs,,,,
134,0:52:50,Yeah they were all normal,,,,
,,,,,,
152,0:53:24,So we're gonna go look at the pictures,,,,
156,0:53:49,"So no labs, he's already got labs correct",,,,
157,0:53:53,No labs,,,,
158,0:53:53,"Yes no labs, we just need to roll him, did we do that already",,,,
159,0:53:56,Yes we did,,,,
160,0:53:57,"On the other side, okay so and we'll check, we'll check the urine for a UA, that's the only lab, and we'll get a pelvis AP view",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161213,,,,,,
165,0:07:38,Guys drawing basic trauma labs,,,,
,,,,,,
180,0:08:48,"We need, we need a better flask",,,,
181,0:08:49,"Oh it means that we're just gonna use a little flask over here, your blood didn't want to come out of this like this, this part, so we're just gonna, we're just gonna use a very very teenie thing to get some blood out okay",,,,
182,0:08:51,Ground reasonable to see a chest X-ray,,,,
183,0:08:59,Is it gonna hurt,,,,
184,0:09:01,It will probably feel less than what I just did,,,,
185,0:09:01,Alright I'm okay holding off on the chest X-ray,,,,
186,0:09:03,Uh we don't get chest X-rays on the grounds of that,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161207,,,,,,
113,0:18:13,"No obvious injuries on primary, secondary survey, but given the mechanism and the symtpoms we'll get a head CT and a uh cervical spine X-ray",,,,
114,0:18:23,Anything else anyone can think of?,,,,
115,0:18:28,Do you want any labs?,,,,
116,0:18:30,Uh yeah we have basic labs,,,,
117,0:18:34,You want basic labs?,,,,
118,0:18:35,Yeah,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161202,,,,,,
182,0:11:50,Um can we get some blood uh--,,,,
183,0:11:53,Gas and labs too,,,,
184,0:11:54,Uh do I wanna get a bedside gas,,,,
185,0:11:57,"See what you can get and otherwise can I get with a, get to a femoral stat for blood, for a gas, if they don't get it",,,,
,,,,,,
191,0:12:45,"We're going to try and get blood for a gas, we're gonna tear, gear up to do a femoral stat to do that",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161203,,,,,,
36,0:16:46,"Um and let's work on getting access, we'll send the uh complete trauma labs",,,,
,,,,,,
85,0:20:34,Complete labs and a dose of morphine soon thereafter please,,,,
,,,,,,
120,0:23:11,"So once we're done getting the blood we'll roll her, do her back",,,,
122,0:23:19,"And then let's get a chest X-ray, cause she's got a proximal left upper extremity deformity and that could also have a clavicle fracture",,,,
124,0:23:31,"Can you repeat that I heard chest X-ray, what else do you want",,,,
125,0:23:33,"So she's got a proximal humerus injury, so I'm thinking chest X-ray with the clavicle, which is my indication for the chest X-ray",,,,
126,0:23:40,And then humerus you want X-rays of that,,,,
127,0:23:42,"So X-rays of bilateral upper extremities, which don't necessary have the clavicle in it",,,,
128,0:23:50,And then we're gonna send full trauma labs,,,,
129,0:23:53,And a lateral C-spine,,,,
130,0:23:56,You said full truama labs,,,,
131,0:23:56,"Yeah, is that enough right",,,,
133,0:24:04,That's enough right,,,,
134,0:24:05,"Yeah perfect, all I need",,,,
135,0:24:06,Is that enough,,,,
136,0:24:08,"I got 2, 2 more",,,,
137,0:24:10,Okay sounds good,,,,
138,0:24:12,If she did nobody told,,,,
139,0:24:14,They didn't order anymore blood works,,,,
,,,,,,
161,0:26:34,"Just the arm X rays, humerus deformed, do you want 2 or just 1",,,,
162,0:26:38,"Just arm X-rays, her hands look fine right",,,,
163,0:26:42,"Hands look fine, just the humerus and forearm",,,,
164,0:26:48,"You're doing this arm, so the right upper",,,,
165,0:26:50,Yeah bilaterally,,,,
,,,,,,
187,0:29:14,"Is it easier for you guys to do all the imaging together, are they gonna shoot all the basic extremities in here or are they gonna bring her to radiology",,,,
188,0:29:16,"No worries, towel, towel",,,,
189,0:29:21,Yup,,,,
190,0:29:23,No we'll get the C-spine here but that's all,,,,
191,0:29:26,Okay just the C-spine,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161128,,,,,,
17,0:06:00,Start getting access and plan to send basic trauma labs.,,,,
,,,,,,
43,0:09:58,Do you want labs for her?,,,,
44,0:09:59,I think we should be okay,,,,
47,0:10:01,Basic trauma labs,,,,
48,0:10:09,How are we doing on labs and access,,,,
,,,,,,
60,0:11:06,"So you said basic trauma labs, do you want add anything",,,,
,,,,,,
71,0:12:03,Alright so let's do basic trauma labs and a lateral sequent film,,,,
72,0:12:06,"Tell her, they want a lateral C-spine",,,,
74,0:12:29,"Alright so it sounds like we have a previously healthy 6 month old female, now stat is posted MBA, vitals are stable, um we'll get access and labs on her, we'll get a lateral C-spine film, and she can go ahead and move out to a room in the main e.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
161127,,,,,,
23,0:01:13,CAT scans have been done right,,,,
24,0:01:14,"Yea they had, they did a CAT scan and a",,,,
25,0:01:18,Multiple fractures,,,,
,,,,,,
67,0:04:43,"Changing table, with outside imaging concerning for multiple uh skull fractures and bleed",,,,
68,0:04:51,"So we gotta upload the imaging, review the imaging, uh we're gonna do a full NAT workup so if he needs NAT labs, uh",,,,
69,0:04:59,The ASD is low elevated,,,,
70,0:05:02,We can repeat it,,,,
71,0:05:07,And skeletal survey?,,,,
72,0:05:08,"Skeletal survey, CAP C, social work",,,,
,,,,,,
83,0:05:49,You said NAT labs right,,,,
84,0:05:51,"Um yea so, yea, I'll",,,,
85,0:05:52,Is that just a basic trauma or,,,,
86,0:05:53,"Uh they do a CMP, CBC, coags, and UA",,,,
,,,,,,
133,0:09:42,"Uh, uh, there's gonna be like coags, basically it's gonna be the ANAT",,,,
134,0:09:45,"Are you okay, I mean",,,,
135,0:09:47,"Green, purple, and blue",,,,
136,0:09:48,"You okay, okay",,,,
137,0:09:48,"So coags, CBC's, CMP, um, and then the bag UA",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
160129,,,,,,
131,0:20:33,"We're gonna get some basic labs, start him on IV fluids, get X-rays of the left, uh leg, entire leg, um, and wait for the results of the labs",,,,
132,0:20:36,Saline's connected,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
160128,,,,,,
94,0:22:46,"Uh so we'll get a CT of the head, uh without contras, and then we'll get plain films of the C-spine, basic labs.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
160126,,,,,,
10,0:08:42,We're gonna ultra sound his belly,,,,
11,0:08:46,We're gonna pick you up okay bud,,,,
,,,,,,
125,0:17:57,"We'll get a chest X-ray, he does have a little bit of um a chest wall tenderness, we're gonna upload the CT scan, and we'll have our trauma lab depending that will lead us to how he's trending, and um, that's where we are.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
160124,,,,,,
144,0:09:00,What kind of labs you need,,,,
145,0:09:04,"Basic, yeah, trauma",,,,
146,0:09:09,Does it have LSTs,,,,
147,0:09:12,What stage trauma,,,,
148,0:09:13,ABC,,,,
149,0:09:14,H and H and um,,,,
150,0:09:20,"Hemoglobin AST, ALT, and UN",,,,
151,0:09:23,Yea that's all I wanted,,,,
152,0:09:32,It was hiding his belly,,,,
153,0:09:35,Do you want any fluids?,,,,
,,,,,,
200,0:13:04,Do you need to do any imaging?,,,,
,,,,,,
230,0:15:10,"Since he lost consciousness, I'd feel safe with a head CT scan",,,,
,,,,,,
278,0:17:39,"So we're gonna get some blood work, we're gonna move to another room, we're gonna get some films of his left forearm and his left knee cause he got squished against the pole buddy",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170545,,,,,,
30,(00:11:07),We'll do basic trauma labs.,,,,
,,,,,,
38,(00:12:51),Did you see the CT?,,,,
39,(00:12:53),"No, I did not, I literally just pulled this stuff out of it.",,,,
40,(00:12:58),"What did… did she just have a head CT, that’s it?",,,,
41,(00:13:00),"Head CT, showed a 2 mm depressed --.",,,,
42,(00:13:03),"Yeah, I didn’t know if we scanned anything else.",,,,
43,(00:13:06),"No, usually with this age we don't have to do the neck because they're not at the risk to get any neck injuries.",,,,
44,(00:13:13),Yeah.,,,,
45,(00:13:14),"So, so that was just neurosurgery, so they'll just make their way down.",,,,
46,(00:13:20),"Okay good, that'd be great.",,,,
47,(00:13:23),"I mean, he looks pretty vigorous, but usually with the depression they like to watch two an hour neuro checks every night at least.",,,,
48,(00:13:30),Is that for the PICU then?,,,,
49,(00:13:32),"Yeah, PICU already knows.",,,,
50,(00:13:36),He looks happy.,,,,
51,(00:13:38),"Well he's not very happy right now, but yes.",,,,
52,(00:13:40),Let me retract that and say…,,,,
53,(00:13:41),He's appropriately annoyed by the fact that we are messing with him…,,,,
54,(00:13:45),And about to stab him.,,,,
55,(00:13:46),And not letting him eat and about to give him an IV.,,,,
56,(00:14:02),Should I continue?,,,,
57,(00:14:03),"If you can continue without getting in her way, then yeah. Yeah.",,,,
,,,,,,
66,(00:15:19),You need all of the labs did you say?,,,,
67,(00:15:20),Basic.,,,,
68,(00:15:21),Basic labs? Okay.,,,,
69,(00:15:22),"Yeah, basic labs. Thank you.",,,,
,,,,,,
91,(00:20:01),It was basic trauma labs.,,,,
,,,,,,
105,(00:23:06),"We'll get basic trauma labs, nurse if you'll consult.",,,,
109,(00:23:19),"They'll get a second read on the head CT, they're gonna upload it, um but..",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170521,,,,,,
59,(00:08:05),"No labs, don't say hospital",,,,
60,(00:08:07),None?,,,,
61,(00:08:08),Do you want basic labs?,,,,
62,(00:08:09),"She was so swollen, drooling earlier.",,,,
63,(00:08:10),Yeah.,,,,
64,(00:08:11),Basic?,,,,
65,(00:08:13),"Yeah, it's decreased in swelling a lot.",,,,
66,(00:08:14),And secondary for the CT. So they come and they brought it.,,,,
67,(00:08:19),"They did, they're uploading it now.",,,,
,,,,,,
78,(00:09:51),"Okay. So let's take a look at her head CT, we'll get basic trauma labs because they didn't get any over there and then I think that's probably it.",,,,
79,(00:10:00),"So basic trauma labs is all you need? CT, saturated CT",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170516,,,,,,
56,(00:41:46),Do you guys want any labs?,,,,
57,(00:41:48),I don't want labs.,,,,
58,(00:41:49),Do you want labs?,,,,
59,(00:41:50),I don't.,,,,
60,(00:41:51),No labs.,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170518,,,,,,
65,(00:08:04),"So we know for sure we'll need a lateral c-spine film, we'll need a CT of his head. We'll need a, whatever the comphrehensive labs are. I think those are standard.",,,,
,,,,,,
116,(00:12:55),I have the CTs ready when you guys are.,,,,
,,,,,,
131,(00:13:48),Whether to get a CT of the face is the only thing. He's got blood in the nose...,,,,
132,(00:13:54),"Yeah, well we're going to head the head, so…",,,,
133,(00:13:56),Just do the face as well.,,,,
,,,,,,
154,(00:15:16),Anybody want the ---- results?,,,,
155,(00:15:17),Please.,,,,

159,(00:15:39),Tell me when you guys are ready for the CT.,,,,
160,(00:15:42),"Yeah, we're ready for the CT.",,,,
,,,,,,
184,(00:17:04),"So let's get a C-spine x-ray now, then we'll go over and get a CT of his head. His face is stable though right?",,,,
185,(00:17:12),"Yeah, just looks like nasal bridge is swollen.",,,,
186,(00:17:15),Let's get a CT of his face then. CT face as well.,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170515,,,,,,
99,(00:10:45),"Um, so we will start with basic trauma labs, we're gonna get a chest X-ray, X-ray of his shoulder and humerous.",,,,
106,(00:11:07),"So, imaging of his shoulder, his humerous and his chest. Basic trauma labs and he's gonna get a bolus.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170514,,,,,,
138,(00:10:30),"---, what are you thinking about for imaging and lab things?",,,,
139,(00:10:35),"I have my thoughts, but I feel like they might want something different.",,,,
,,,,,,
196,(00:15:44),Do you want them to x-ray him now? Or… can we do his leg here? Do we do the leg now?,,,,
197,(00:15:52),I'm fine with that. I don't know what the orders are.,,,,
198,(00:15:54),"Can we do that? Yeah, just tell him what we want.",,,,
199,(00:16:00),So he's having hip pain so we should probably get a pelvis and then he was also complaining of pain the lower leg.,,,,
200,(00:16:05),So a pelvis and a tibfib.,,,,
201,(00:16:07),Pelvis and tibfib sounds good.,,,,
202,(00:16:08),"Okay, alright.",,,,
203,(00:16:09),No c-spine? You want c-spine right?,,,,
204,(00:16:11),"Yes, that was part of his...",,,,
205,(00:16:12),"Okay, c-spine, pelvis and um…",,,,
206,(00:16:14),Tibfib.,,,,
207,(00:16:14),Right tibfib?,,,,
208,(00:16:15),Yes please.,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170513,,,,,,
40,(00:05:16),Basic trauma.,,,,
,,,,,,
56,(00:06:48),So we're getting the basic labs and c-spine?,,,,
57,(00:06:50),That sounds good.,,,,
58,(00:06:51),Thank you.,,,,
59,(00:07:25),So we'll also just get a lateral c-spine X-ray.,,,,
60,(00:07:28),Okay.,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170509,,,,,,
83,(00:25:45),Do you feel like you want to get trauma labs?,,,,
85,(00:25:48),"No, I don't think so.",,,,
,,,,,,
179,(00:30:15),"Alright, so I think the plan going forward is we'll change her out to Miami J. We'll get an X-ray of her chest, her right wrist, and c-spine T and L. Okay? Anybody have..",,,,
180,(00:30:24),The X-ray? Say that again.,,,,
181,(00:30:26),"CTL, right wrist, and chest.",,,,
190,(00:31:07),And a pelvic X-ray,,,,
191,(00:31:15),"Okay, so we summarize saying she has C, T and L tenderness, right wrist, right chest wall and right hip. So we're going to get X-rays of C-spine, T and L, chest, right wrist, and pelvis.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170507,,,,,,
45,(00:59:28),What imaging do they have?,,,,
46,(00:59:30),"They have a head CT, which we're getting moved up now.",,,,
53,(01:00:14),"I mean, alright, so we just want to hold it until we get an X-ray. I mean, I just think we need to at least evaluate c-spine.",,,,
54,(01:00:23),"That's fine, and then we can… you want a CT c-spine?",,,,
55,(01:00:27),"No, just like a little X-ray is fine.",,,,
56,(01:00:29),"Okay, we'll just hold him till the films.",,,,
57,(01:00:31),Okay.,,,,
,,,,,,
65,(01:01:15),"No, we're gonna get C-spine films and see what those look like. We're gonna get the C head loaded and then…",,,,
66,(01:01:23),You want them before you…?,,,,
67,(01:01:24),Correct. And we're working with Medstar hospital to get that read.,,,,
68,(01:01:28),The destination is an isssue. So is he trauma or NICU? Are we going to find out?,,,,
69,(01:01:33),"Yeah, I want to see the stuff first though. And I do want basic trauma labs, cause he fell right?",,,,
70,(01:01:41),"Alright, so I'm going to look at the scans and we'll talk to Neurosurgery once they look at himjust to see how close monitering we want overnight. But I suspect he should be able to go to the floor.",,,,
73,(01:02:15),Hello. What are our plans for c-spine? Is it clear?,,,,
74,(01:02:21),You are sitting there holding it.,,,,
75,(01:02:22),No. You're gonna hold c-spine.,,,,
76,(01:02:23),We're not gonna put in the brakes?,,,,
77,(01:02:25 ),Apparently not.,,,,
78,(01:02:28),We're not doing an CT?,,,,
79,(01:02:29),We're doing a X-ray of his neck. -- is ordering it now.,,,,

,,,,,,
170508,,,,,,
155,(00:20:24),"No, I want X-rays first.",,,,
162,(00:20:52),"Alright, so… Yeah, change the collar, that's fine. So we're gonna get basic trauma labs, c-spine X-ray, we'll have dental come and look at the tooth.",,,,

246,(00:49:02),We're gonna get a quick chest x-ray over here to make sure we're not missing any other injuries. And for placement. We're gonna get a head CT and a chest CT. We have full trauma labs that are pending.,,,,

,,,,,,
233,(00:13:50),We'll get x-rays,,,,
237,(00:14:17),So I think we're gonna do basic trauma labs and we're just gonna do x-rays of that left arm,,,,

239,(00:14:23),Yes,,,,
,,,,,,

,,,,,,
170410,,,,,,
26,(00:12:27),We'll need a chest X-ray.,,,,

78,(00:08:38),I would get cervical spine,,,,
79,(00:08:39),"Yeah, I think that's fair. I think that's fair. And then based on labs we can decide whether he needs belly. He didn't lose consciousness?",,,,
87,(00:08:56),C-spine?,,,,
88,(00:08:58),It helps. Not right now.,,,,
89,(00:09:00),"Okay. And complete, I'm just gonna get belly and extremity labs.",,,,

7,(00:33:07),To the left temporal? Okay,,,,
,,,,,,
95,(00:39:50),Okay. Do we have any labs that came with him from the outside hospital?,,,,
96,(00:39:53),"Yes, we do.",,,,
97,(00:39:54),Okay. Do we want any more labs here?,,,,
98,(00:39:56),Yes.,,,,
99,(00:39:57),What labs you want?,,,,
100,(00:39:57),"If you want, get them now, while I'm drawing blood.",,,,
101,(00:39:59),Enough for full coags and uh the comprehensive trauma labs and an iSTAT,,,,
102,(00:40:05),"Okay. So as soon as you get the labs, we're gonna roll him.",,,,
103,(00:40:08),Okay and then we're waiting on the imaging,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170113,,,,,,
132,(00:19:21),"Nope. Sounds like we're taking basic labs, chest x-ray",,,,
133,(00:19:27),I got that,,,,
134,(00:19:28),Left tib-fib,,,,
135,(00:19:29),Left tib-fib. That's all?,,,,
136,(00:19:30),Yup,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170221,,,,,,
10,(00:32:14),We have to take this out for the chest X-ray.,,,,
,,,,,,
258,(00:46:30),"After the chest tube placement, we will get an X-ray…",,,,
259,(00:46:33),X ray and then CT.,,,,
260,(00:46:34),And then CT.,,,,
261,(00:46:37),"And while we're doing that, do you mind pulling up the the X-ray --, have it ready to go.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170305,,,,,,
50,(00:03:16),So can we get a set of trauma labs?,,,,
52,(00:03:19),Basic or comprehensive?,,,,
55,(00:03:22),Basic or comprehensive?,,,,
,,,,,,
195,(00:14:56),Did you want tib fib or whole leg?,,,,
196,(00:14:58),"I think we need tib fib, femur, and right hip and pelvis.",,,,
197,(00:15:12),"Actually yeah, why don't you do.. Why don't we do right forearm?",,,,
198,(00:15:18),Just forearm?,,,,
199,(00:15:19),"Well, they usually, the forearm includes the wrist so..",,,,
200,(00:15:27),"And then we're doing right tib fib, femur and pelvis, correct?",,,,
201,(00:15:31),Yeah.,,,,
,,,,,,
236,(00:20:03),Did you want c-spine films?,,,,
237,(00:20:07),I don't think so.,,,,

252,(00:21:27),Comprehensive.,,,,
253,(00:21:28),"Comprehensive. So we're getting comprehensive trauma labs and a c-spine, a pelvis X-ray, a right hip, a right forearm…",,,,
254,(00:21:40),Elbow and wrist as well.,,,,
255,(00:21:42),Lumbar --,,,,
256,(00:21:44),LL spine and…,,,,
257,(00:21:46),Head CT or no head CT?,,,,
258,(00:21:48),No head CT at this point.,,,,
259,(00:21:49),Okay.,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170118,,,,,,
62,(00:11:57),We're gonna just start basic trauma labs. ,,,,
,,,,,,
74,(00:18:35),"No images, let's get basic trauma labs. ",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170116,,,,,,
259,(00:15:34),"Alright for right now, let's just do c, lateral c-spine films and then we'll see how those look before we go any further. I'm gonna hold off on any labs. ",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170119,,,,,,
116,(00:18:07),Basic labs.,,,,
122,(00:18:30),"…Humerus, elbow. ",,,,
123,(00:18:32),"Humerus and elbow, that's it?",,,,
124,(00:18:34),"And then basic labs, ---, and then let's get him out of this room. ",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170419,,,,,,
22,(00:04:55),The x-rays came. But I don't know whether they did that at --,,,,
23,(00:04:59),So what do we wanna do about his neck?,,,,
24,(00:05:02),"They did x-ray his neck, and they told me, but they don't, I don't have a read of his x-ray. They told me they x-rayed his neck and they were sure that it was negative but I don't have a read and I couldn't get a clincal update.",,,,
34,(00:05:33),"So just so you know, I'm looking at their, their, what they wrote on the outside of the disc.",,,,
36,(00:05:39),"They just did a a bone survey, they didn't do dedicated c-spine still.",,,,
,,,,,,
53,(00:07:11),Do we have any labs done now?,,,,
,,,,,,
73,(00:09:05),Alright and he already had a CAT scan we pulled from the other hospital,,,,
74,(00:09:07),"Correct. It's being uploaded, what their actual read is nondisplaced right sided posterior skull fracture and a question trace subarachnoid hemorrhage verses artifcat in the right occipital region. And um, and then apparently I was, I had asked them to image his c-spine and chest given the mechanism, but it looks like they did an entire bone survey with his skeletal survey, so I don't think we've gotten dedicated c-spine done. Um, but, I mean",,,,
80,(00:09:50),"And I also asked them to do a hemoglobin ASC, ALT and a urine",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170418,,,,,,
121,(00:39:56),CT head first.,,,,
,,,,,,
132,(00:41:33),"For getting him up to CT can we make sure we have a bag? He's gonna go up to the CT scan, we might should go up with him, we have an O2 tank and a bag and a bag mask ventilator.",,,,

,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170416,,,,,,
62,(00:17:49),You just need to review the CT scan and then take a look at the labs.,,,,
63,(00:17:57),"Ah, you want coags as well?",,,,
64,(00:17:59),No.,,,,
65,(00:18:00),No?,,,,
66,(00:18:01),"Unless neurosurg wants them based on the, the bleed.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170415,,,,,,
67,(00:12:23),"No? Ok so we're gonna do CT head, face, C-spine x-rays, and labs.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170412,,,,,,
8,(00:08:26),We have the images?,,,,
9,(00:08:28),"We do, right here. I'll give it to these guys out here.",,,,
,,,,,,
14,(00:10:55),Did they send trauma labs?,,,,
15,(00:10:59),"Um, I'm sure, but I haven't checked",,,,
16,(00:11:02),They took blood and urine.,,,,
,,,,,,
30,(00:13:15),"Alright, here we go, urine, two red cells",,,,
,,,,,,
40,(00:14:08),"Okay. Alright, um, and the only obvious injury is the periorbital edema to the right eye and some abrasions a hematoma maybe on the forehead and some swelling. Um, so, you know we want to get some imaging we alreay have some, but if we do any of the head here, we just review that stuff. Do we have labs for him?",,,,
41,(00:14:30),"Labs are done. He has an AST of 54 and other than that, everything is good.",,,,
42,(00:14:36),"So that's fine, this is regular trauma, and do we have a AU and all that?",,,,
43,(00:14:42),Yup.,,,,
44,(00:14:43),Hema- er- hemaglobin?,,,,
45,(00:14:44),12,,,,
46,(00:14:47),"Um, and the face CT, we'll just have to look at, but otherwise.",,,,
47,(00:14:50),"Yeah, radiology just needs to review his stuff and then..",,,,
48,(00:14:54),And then we should be good I don't think,,,,
,,,,,,
59,(00:15:48),"And then, NPO, are we doing IV fluids?",,,,
60,(00:15:52),NPO until we look at the images and then he's gonna be ok,,,,
61,(00:15:54),Ok,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170406,,,,,,
70,(00:19:39),They should get the lateral c-spine too,,,,
,,,,,,
87,(00:21:41),"Head CT was done already at the outset facility, it was normal. ALC/AST were done, normal. He had a chest x-ray, he's gonna get another chest x-ray now, he's gonna get a lateral c-spine, he has a UA pending, he'll go up to the PICU and get extubated when he's there.",,,,
,,,,,,

170308,,,,,,
91,16:37,Can we get a basic traum..,,,,

93,16:41,"He has a CBC, he has a BMP",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170304,,,,,,
63,(00:38:16),Can we just get the X-ray to confirm the ET tube placement and while they put the additional IV?,,,,
64,(00:38:22),Sure.,,,,
66,(00:38:25),"Whoa, wait hold on. We gotta get the X-ray first, then we can move onto the secondary. They still need to put an IV.",,,,
67,(00:38:34),"--, can we get the X-ray real quick? Just to make sure the ET tube is in the right place and then we can get the labs?",,,,
68,(00:38:41),Thanks.,,,,
