118,,"Okay so she's 8 years old. We got on the scene and saw a kid laying on the concrete. We saw a kid laying down on the concrete she had some blood on the floor, on the ground. She didn't know what happen, it went out as a pedestrian struck. It was a very low speed area, so something was wrong we saw a window,  three floors up. We had them investigate there was a chair at the bottom of the window. The window was open, she was conscious crying, didn't want us to help her. It took a little to console her, got her down. Once we got her on the ground, we notice that her right leg is rotated out. ",,,,,
119,,Not if it rotated out and there is a little bit of deformity right there,,,,,
121,,Left leg?,,,,,
122,,Left leg,,,,,
123,,"I do, I did eventually get an IV in the left AC, 20 gauge. Her pressure has been stable the whole time, no abdominal rigidity, no pain, no chest. Head all intact, nothing in the head, pupils were equal and reactive. Some blood from the mouth and nose and some blood on the ground, doesn't appear to be any damage there and she's been talking to us and everything the whole time. GCS throughout has been 15, she does not know what happened and she does not know what happen, she does not know if she was up stair or down on the ground and she does not have the ability to move her left leg",,,,,
124,,That should be good,,,,,
126,,Her vitals were normal?,,,,,
127,,"All stable, she was slightly tachy like around 130 when she saw her mom about 150. Blood sugar was 140",,,,,
128,,Her airway is patent and protected,,,,,
129,,Breathe sounds are cleared bilaterally,,,,,
130,,"We have two plus pulses bilaterally, lower extremities. Her cap refill is  about 2 seconds, 2 to 3. It's 2 on the right, it's a little delay, 3 on the left",,,,,
132,,"Ok so we are going to do a summary real quick. This is our 6 year old who likely fell out of a third story window, approximately 30 feet. Was found without loss of consciousness at the scene. Normal vitals brought in, primary survey is intact, including a GCS of 15. On secondary survey [beep] help me with this because I missed some of the stuff she got dried blood on her hands and nose and a deformity of her left femur that’s tender but otherwise no other findings",,,,,
239,,"She was also complaining of some mild cervical discomfort, some right clavicle discomfort, none of these have any deformity or obvious, [zero pain]. And also some belly pain and her abdomen is a little distended.",,,,,
240,,"So she is getting a bolus of 20 per kilo of L R that is already running, she's gotten 30 Fentanyl for the pain score of 8 out of 10, ahh, we are going to get a lateral c-spine x-ray which we can do here and then she is gonna get a pelvic and left femur x-ray to rule out a fracture, why don’t we add on a two view of the right clavicle, I don’t know where N A L is, and we have sent basic labs, that includes hemaglobin, AST, ALT, and a UA",,,,,
241,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160519,(0:20:52),Right so let's just do a summary for [beep].,,,,,
138,(0:20:54),"He is a 12 to 13 year old, was hit by a car 20 miles an hour no L.O.C. umm, vitals stable in the field, primary survey intact, secondary survey significant for an abrasion and some tenderness over the right hip and thigh. Umm, he should get some morphine cause his pain score was 7 to 8 out of 10 so we could do that, he is getting an [embolus] of a liter through his 20 gauge he has basic labs that will be sent and then a pelvic x-ray in addition to a to the right femur x-ray and his C-spine has been clinically cleared.",,,,,
139,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160523,(0:03:36),"Alright so vitals are fine, not in shock. ABC's all intact, GCS is 15.",,,,,
39,(0:14:14),"I'll summarize guys, overall here. So we're here with 13 minutes in, this Angelo he's 15,14, Angelo 14 year old male, no significant medical history other than his left ankle surgery. He was standing on a wall fell about 15 feet, no loss of consciousness, GCS was 15 at the scene and both here. ABC's are all intact, from that stand point. Only obvious injury we can see on secondary survey is he's got abrasion on the right forehead obvious deformity, a left wrist or distal forearm, and he's got some old abrasion, maybe on the right knee, maybe a fresh one on the left from there. In term of [applying?], we got his C spine immobilize, although I think he'll be able to clear clinically, but we'll get lateral C spines behind films for him",,,,,
163,(0:14:56),"And we'll also get plain films of the left wrist and I think we should get the distal forearms at hand, as well just give him the location of it from there. We'll get basic trama labs and pending all that imaging, I think that  we'll attempt too see what we can do with the C spine, from there",,,,,
164,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160524,(0:00:09),"12 year old football player that had an injury and felll during football today, no LOC, but sleepy and lethargic. GCS is 14, I asked them to place a saline lock and immobilze his C-spine. They said alert and oriented, but sleepy and lethargic, so I'm a little confuse",,,,,
2,(0:01:22),"Okay 12 year old here, football practice. Had a fall, no loss of consciousness, but is slightly [depress?] GCS in 14. We'll reevalute here, our estimated weight is 40 kilo",,,,,
19,(0:01:34),"Stats were good 98%, vitals were fine, good BP impluses",,,,,
20,(0:09:07),"This is Elijah, he's 12 year old male. He was playing kickball on a hard surface, he collided with another player, head first fell down. He was sluggish when he woke up, they place a GCS of  like 13. He's been at a GCS of 15 for us, remembers the whole incident, small hematoma [...] through his head other than that that's it",,,,,
99,(0:16:33 ),"So basically this is a 12 year old male with a kickball injury. Is that right, fall during kickball. Some initial alter GCS, now GCS is 15. You know diagnosis possible concussion. He's hemo-dynamically stable, we can just move him to the ED and observe him waiting for his family. Anybody have any other suggestion, comments, concerns",,,,,
197,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160601,(0:05:59),So just so everyone is aware now that we have a full team 2 year old coming in to transit from an outside hospital her injured cranial bleed fall down 8 stairs has had a C T head through pelves with a hematoma and a possible small [under brain small hematoma].,,,,,
83,(0:06:16),Has not been intimated at a G C S of 15 though some concern about the ability to assess of the outside hospital. We’re working on 12 kilogram weight for a 2 year old.,,,,,
84,(0:06:28),"Anticipating a minimum now primary and secondary survey and getting the images reread, umm, and then if the child is looking stable obviously there could be a [white dem] until we decide what's there is on top and if it's more concerning we can [deal with it].",,,,,
85,(0:14:34),"And at 8 o'clock this morning ahh she was found outside the house and she ahh fell down said about 8 steps which were concrete steps no known loss of consciousness, ahh, cried immediately ahh dad picked her up put her in the car and started going to the hospital says she fell asleep on the way over so she’s not sure if she truly did loss concess at all but at this point reporting no loss of consciousness she, umm, when shes asleep verbal, ahh, pain assimilation wakes her up she responds perfect she wants to be up stretch be in moms arms. She has no known history of anything no med no allergies ahh, head C T there showed a questionable left.",,,,,
153,(0:15:14),Notion or anything no skull fracture ahh off the chest x-ray off [of contusion] pulmonary contusion ahh says she no no other known restrictions or [dualities] she has an I V affixed in her right hand she has received no body fluids no medications ahh at the other hospital or transport she has been responding appropriately once again in the moms and dads arms.,,,,,
154,(0:20:12),Ok guys we are going to summarize.,,,,,
193,(0:20:21),"So we got a toddler, with a concern for an intracranial bleed primary survey is unremarkable reassuring G C S given that she is moving her neck we will not put her in a neck splint, I’m sorry cervical collar, umm, we will get comprehensive trauma legs actually concern that she has pulmonary contusion possibility in addition to the head, umm, we will need to talk to nurse once the C T is uploaded that's happening now, umm, I don’t think she has any immediate medication needs, ahh, and I anticipate transferring her to one of our beds going to keep a close eye on her pending the read of the C T nero search console and then if there is finding on that admission.",,,,,
194,(0:21:02),"Ahh, she has an abrasion on her left, left side of her back.",,,,,
195,(0:21:06),Left side back.,,,,,
196,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160621,(0:20:42),"Alright we’ll summarize real quick. this is a 19 month old, ahh, female, that took fall, ahh, second, ahh, two stories, with ahh, no loss of consciousness reportedly but no witness. Umm, even with dynamically stable primary survey is negative secondary survey, ahh, negative as well he has according to mom has had two days of upper respiratory infection has had quite a bit of sacreation.",,,,,
154,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160649,(0:07:19),"Before we move forward, can we just, someone read off the vitals. And then if you have any concern, before we move to secondary, state them.",,,,,
85,(0:07:28),"Thirty-five eight, one-o-seven, twenty, one twenty-four over sixty-two uh by [dyna map?] and one ten over sixty-eight by manual",,,,,
86,(0:13:05),"Uh to summarize this is John Doe, unclear age we're assuming ten years-old. Struck while he was riding a scooter by a motor vehicle, unclear speed of the vehicle, so based on mechanism alone his GCS is thirteen.",,,,,
148,(0:13:22),"We're gonna get a CT-scan of his head dry. We're gonna get basic labs ASTALUTA hemoglobins and a UA. He doesn't have any other recognizable deformities, besides a small abrasion on his knee and the laceration over the left post of his [ox-put]",,,,,
149,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160652,(0:09:03),"16 year old female, ahh, hit by a car going about 15 miles per hour witnesses say there was no loss of consciousness she spoke the entire time, patent however was repeating questions ahh throughout the ride here asking the same questions over and over again. Ahh she does have some left leg pain upon movement not upon palpitations she's got a bunch of abrasion along the right side, ahh, starting here some on the back of the spine no pain down there. Umm, obviously I V established. Uhh she does have a contusion to the back of her head. Shes getting, She just started to get a headache just now as we got here. Ahh, people’s pearl the whole time, ahh, able to speak through the whole ride. 8 out of 8 times of 4 except for the ahh, questioning of where her mother is where her family members where what happened.",,,,,
114,(0:21:20),So let's take a moment to summarize 17 year old pedestrian hit by vehicle about 15 miles per hours so umm theoretically stable at this point we're going to get x-rays right shoulder elbow and wrist as well as the left femur and then go over for a head C T since she complained of ahh headaches.,,,,,
224,(0:21:37),And then c-spine x-rays as well.,,,,,
225,(0:21:38),And c-spine as well.,,,,,
226,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160654,(0:02:27),"So was ahh on his bike in a alley and a vehicle struck him on the right side. Umm, knocked him from his bicycle not wearing a helmet but he says he did not loose concensiness umm and his only complaint is to his right leg from ankle to thigh ahh as far as we could tell no deformity, he is naturally pigeon toed so both of his feet are turned inward. Umm but lung sound good, pupils good umm, he's moving good air he's alert oriented G C S is 15. Umm.",,,,,
35,(0:10:26),So we completed the secondary survey just in summery this is an 8 year old ahh boy who was hit by a car and was on his bicycle no loss of consciousness umm most concern is the right lower extremity C collar can be cleared umm I would do it after we get x-rays going just in case though ahh lets get go ahead and get femur and then lower leg foot just because we can’t rule out anything just on the femur ahh we’ll go from there.,,,,,
130,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
160723,(0:04:45),"…[cursion?] to the rear, which pushed her car seat up, almost all the way into the front seat. Um She was actually in a perfect little pocket, she was pretty well conserved. Her leg was stuck and it was stuck actually in the plastic right here of the car seat, so they did have to extracate her. She's been awake and alert the whole time. She is obviously getting a little sleepy. She has significant laceration coming off the left eye, she also has what look like a possibly broken left jaw. It was the left leg that was stuck, although she is complaining of tenderness in her right elbow and right leg as well",,,,,
7,(0:17:58),"Okay left [TM?] is cleared no blood, so in summary",,,,,
137,(0:18:03),Passenger in a […] by a bus with significant intrusion. She was restrained in her car seat had significant intrusion um primary survey negative GCS,,,,,
138,(0:18:19),"Secondary survey significant for left eye swelling, laceration, uh swelling at the left jaw, left arm tenderness discomfort hard to pin point exactly where it is, but I think it from shoulder through left wrist. Bilateral lower extremities with thighs, knees, ankles swelling and superficial overlying of laceration and abrasion over bilateral lower extremities.",,,,,
139,(0:18:51),"So two concerns right know, if this is a femur fracture it was very stable before and it's not now. If we could just find a way, somebody could just straighten that leg out and wrap it that would be great",,,,,
140,(0:19:05),I only have,,,,,
141,(0:19:09),She seems to be in a position of comfort. Let's just go through labs and,,,,,
142,(0:19:13),"Sure,so we're gonna have standard labs. We are gonna get a head CT based on intrusion of the vehicle. We're going to get a left upper extremity of the upper arm, elbow, forearm, and hand views. We're going to get a pelvis film, bilateral femur, bilateral [...],bilateral [tipfeb?], bilateral feet.

0:14:33,"Great […] stable just a little uh tact [..], but could be a little distress. We're not concerned about it um IV's working, so we'll get a basic set of trama labs um and then we can proceed with our secondary survey unless anyone else has any concerns",,,,,,
,,,,,,,
0:23:49,"So let's summarize, this our uh six week male. Status post fall the subdural hematoma and outside CT scan, […] stable with a stable hemagloblin at the outside facilities, so we're likely gonna transfer him for neurovascular exam.

,,,,,,,
0:24:49,"We have this uh forty day old the trama with the subdural. He is stable, but we need a room. Pick something on D-side, I don't have anything. Are you by board or no?",,,,,,

2,(0:04:03),"Great so we have a four year old who was in an [MVC?]. The car seat came unhooked or maybe it was booster and he slammed with the seat in front of him, which had an LCD screen. The screen is broken and that whole seat is broken, apparently, they think from the force of the child hitting it. He had LSC at the scene and has a lot of frontal bruising and hematoma and I don't know what else, but is alert and oriented.",,,,,
3,(0:04:33),Our estimate weight is about seventeen kilograms,,,,,
5,(0:06:37),"Just to get you up to date with everything, were getting a four year old who was in an MVC sounds like she was restrained, but something about those restraints broke, so then she hits the seats…",,,,,

23,(0:10:26),"He's four years old. We guessed about 20 kilos, dad wasn't sure. Dad is here with us. They were in the backseat of a minivan. Then it struck other vehicle in the back. He went forward hit the seat, on where it has those little tv screens and uh initially after the accident he was crying and all that stuff and has slowly become sluggish.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
28,(0:11:07),"No meds, no history, no allergies um that basically it. We're not positive, but there's almost a little bit of [deconjugate?] um that we noticed here coming in",,,,,
29,(0:11:27),What kind of car seat was he in?,,,,,
30,(0:11:33),A booster seat,,,,,

170107,,,,,,,
2,(0:03:08),"Okay so fourteen year old female collided with another basketballplayer while playing basketball. Suffered amnesia, has photophobia, and they're giving here a GCS of thirteen. [...] stable by ten",,,,,
3,(0:03:28),"Okay take out the bair hugger, oxygen, trauma shears",,,,,
7,(0:03:38),And estimated weight is fifty kilos,,,,,
9,(0:03:43),We're getting the meds out of the [ficcets?],,,,,
13,(0:04:03),Do you know the age?,,,,,
14,(0:04:05),Fourteen years old,,,,,
15,(0:04:06),"Fourteen, fifty kilos",,,,,
,,,,,,,
45,(0:07:34),The head is the only thing we're worried about?,,,,,
46,(0:07:36),"Yeah they said possible low consciousness, [photophobia], GCS of thirteen",,,,,
47,(0:07:43),Going to another skull,,,,,
,,,,,,,
95,(0:15:48),Uh collision from a basketball game.,,,,,
98,(0:16:18),Vital signs were otherwise [perform normally?],,,,,
,,,,,,,
255,(0:25:13),Okay so this is a fourteen year old female,,,,,
256,(0:25:17),"Uh collision while playing basketball. Uh GCs of fourteen initally with some uh amnesia. Is reporting some tenderness in the thoracic spine. We're gonna get some basic labs, get a CT of the head. Plain field of the [C-spine?]",,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
170126,,,,,,,
3,(0:00:08),So ten year old fell at gymnastics positive L O C now alert. Hemodynamically fine. They're about 3 minutes out.,,,,,
4,(0:00:22),Positive L O C.,,,,,
5,(0:00:26),Oddly I also know that she fell on a carpeted surface.,,,,,
,,,,,,,
41,(0:03:04),"Surgical senior is right outside. Ok so this is a ahh 10 year old who was at gymnastics, fell had loss of consciousness is now alert with a reassuring blood pressure ahh they should be here any minute by helicopter.",,,,,
43,(0:03:32),So I anticipate that we will check her mental status if she is alert oriented hemodynamically stable then go from there.,,,,,
,,,,,,,
55,(0:07:17),Ten year old at gymnastics fell and loss consciousness fell onto a carpeted surface [...].,,,,,
56,(0:07:39),I was like what is the story here like fall from.,,,,,
57,(0:07:44),Parallel bars or how or uneven bars.,,,,,
,,,,,,,
70,(0:10:44),"Ten years old she was doing some sort of gymnastics at a uhh friend's like birthday party in the basement. On the carpet slid fell believed she struck her head in some point. Ahh family or the adult that where there witnessed a loss of consciousness they tried to keep her awake they weren't very successful with that. Umm unknown how long the loss of consciousness was but when I got to her she was responsive to verbal stimuli she was complaining of head pain kind of everything hurts all over ahh E M S reported, that she was ahh combatted which is why they restrained her extra ahh to the board. As we were coming down through the elevator she ahh said she's doing fine but her head hurts. She will open her eyes ahh she's got an 18 gage I V in her left A C no meds no allergies no history.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
188,(0:23:43),So in summary this is a 10 year old female ahh who fell ahh while doing gymnastics first loss of consciousness right now presentation G C S of 13 other then that ahh ahh baited airway ahh she has ahh heightened access on the right A C ahh bilateral pulses and ahh no other significant issues and ahh second survey she doesn&rsquo;t have any open lacerations or anything. Umm so.,,,,,

92,(0:09:27),So two to three feet?,,,,,
93,(0:09:29),Yeah,,,,,

13,0:02:25,"So he fell, hit his head, no loss of consciousness, uh has hemotympana um, I believe it's the left side, and a parietal simple fracture here.",,,,,
14,0:02:34,"Um so because of the hemotympanum they did a head CT, they didn't do temporal cuts, so there's pneumcephali um and they see a nondisplaced parietal uh simple skull fracture, so my guess is that that goes into the temporal bone and that's what um pneumocephali is.",,,,,
15,0:02:49,When did this happen?,,,,,
16,0:02:55,"Let's say 5 hours ago? Uh maybe 3 or 4 hours, 3 or 4, hours ago, I took the call maybe about an hour and a half ago.",,,,,

1,(00:01:21),What happened? What happened?,,,,,
2,(00:01:23),"Uh, dirt bike verses dirt bike, helmet, questionable LOC.",,,,,
3,(00:01:55),"Alright so guys listen, I'm --, I'm the ED Attending. Our priorities are: IV access for him for pain control, we'll get him off the board, we have a surgical resident who's gonna do our primary and secondary. Yes you are, absolutely.",,,,,
4,(00:02:08),"Ok, alright so please, airway, ABC, very organized.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
63,(00:06:53),"So this is um so --, he's a 8 year-old boy who is a motocross driver who collided with another driver. Helmet and no LOC.",,,,,
64,(00:07:02),"We were gonna call it just eyeball it, but he had enough significant other things that we made it a trauma stat.",,,,,
65,(00:07:07),"So he just came from the scene, -- medic, he's got a significant um distal femur deformity with you know an open corner to it, so airway, breathing, circulation, he has good aeration, good chest-wise, he is so 8 year-old, motocross, head-on with another player.",,,,,
66,(00:07:24),"No LOC, but a significant we were just gonna call it at the board, but we decided to upgrade it. Significant amount of distal femur is open, yeah.",,,,,
67,(00:07:32),"So our order of things are airways, breathing, circulation, fine. Good pulses, etcetera, good everything. He needs IV access, more pain control, he's had a total of 60 mcgs of fentanyl um and he's gonna get some ancef. And then we'll, as soon as we have IV pain control and he's stable enough, I'd like to roll him.",,,,,
68,(00:07:49),"At that point, probably should stabilize him with this. Something to help him get off this board.",,,,,
69,(00:07:59),"Um, no allergies, no medications, nothing. 25 kilo kid.",,,,,
70,(00:08:04),And he's had nothing,,,,,
71,(00:08:05),He's set to get belly labs,,,,,
72,(00:08:07),"Right, so nothing done at another hospital?",,,,,
73,(00:08:09),"No, he's right from the field.",,,,,
74,(00:08:18),"He has an in- a lac […] there's several things that need to be repaired, like the lac to the left elbow, but major systems are okay.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
170421,,,,,,,
1,(00:08:21),"So this is a two year-old that we have. No history, was in a sandbox, tree came down and struck the child on the right side. Obvious crepitus on the right side, he had no signs of life when we got there, uh he did have a heart of 160, intubation NG tube, he went […]",,,,,

8,(00:33:08),"Fentanyl, ativan, widen down the dominant to accommodate and suction […] intubation",,,,,

,,,,,,,
91,(00:39:25),"So so far just a quick summary, we went through the primary survey, we've already summarized that.",,,,,
92,(00:39:31),"GCS has been upgraded to a 9T right now. He's moved all extremities, um opens eyes spontaneously, verbal we can't assess because he's intubated.",,,,,
93,(00:39:40),So the only thing we have right now is blood in the left uh ear canal. That's it.,,,,,

,,,,,,,
170113,,,,,,,
1,(00:10:08),"Alright, this is --. -- is 8 years old.",,,,,
2,(00:10:11),Sounds like he was behind mom's car when mom was backing up.,,,,,
3,(00:10:17),"Mom I guess felt the impact, got out, saw that he was under the car briefly, moved the car forward and uh got the car off of him right away.",,,,,
4,(00:10:29),"When EMS got there, he was prone but he was awake for them.",,,,,
5,(00:10:35),GCS has been fine. He says he doesn't remember what happened but he does deny any loss of consciousness.,,,,,
6,(00:10:40),"He's got a little bit of blood on uh both nares, not sure where it's coming from.",,,,,

4,(00:07:10),Yeah all you gotta do is remove those head blocks. ,,,,,
5,(00:07:11),He was initially crying and very upset upon our arrival and then he's become…,,,,,
6,(00:07:20),He's become very tired and lethargic since then. ,,,,,

2,(00:11:47),"Um, this is --, motor vehicle crash, his grandfather went next door. ",,,,,
3,(00:11:52),"Only significant thing to note is a deformity to the right humerus that the BLS, or I mean the ALS on scene secured before I got there but they described it as a deformity he was holding on his own before they got then.",,,,,
4,(00:12:02),He's alert and oriented. ,,,,,
5,(00:12:03),"History of autism, normally has trouble telling his left from his right but when I checked his PMS, he was able to tell me what side I was -- and all that normally.",,,,,
6,(00:12:11),"Other than that, the only other discomfort, discomfort he reports is the uh backboard is causing a little bit of discomfort. ",,,,,
7,(00:12:18),"Other than that, the arm is the only thing he is complaining of. Just some bumps and bruises all over from the crash. ",,,,,

9,(00:03:08),"Yes, -- was in with dad and mom and they were on the third floor bedroom, and he was next to the window, and he broke out the window, through the screen and out the window, but there's a second floor deck, so that helped with that. We have a skull fracture",,,,,
,,,,,,,
72,(00:08:47),"Alright so to recap, primary survey was clear. Secondary survey, just a hematoma over the right forehead.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
170418,,,,,,,
1,(00:31:15),"So uh, he was uh, doing doughnuts on a dirtbike. And a car approached and he lost control of the uh motorcycle and fell off. He uh- witnesses on the scene said he was knocked unconscious from the fall. And then when EMS arrived we used like a sternal rub, and it was difficult to get him awake. And he's been, he's been combative. His, uh pupils were dilated and a little slow to react.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
128,(00:41:06),Do we know if he fell on concrete or on like dirt?,,,,,
129,(00:41:11),"He was riding a motorcycle and he went to turn around and he skidded, and they're not sure if he hit his head or anything. But it would've probably been on concrete. And then a car bumped him, in the head.",,,,,
130,(00:41:26),The car bumped?,,,,,
131,(00:41:28),"They said the car had no injury, there was nothing on the car, but he was in the street",,,,,
,,,,,,,
135,(00:42:06),You wanna do the quick summary? Quick summary of injuries.,,,,,
136,(00:42:12),"Okay. Primary survey, negative.",,,,,
137,(00:42:14),"Guys quiet, we're having a summary survey!",,,,,
138,(00:42:16),"So I'm gonna say at this point with his GCS, he's opening his eyes to pain, 2, he's using oriented words, 5, but he's also only localizing pain, 5. So 2, 5, 5, so 12. Our primary survey is negative, our pupils are dilated, but equal and reactive, our secondary survey is positive for possible left occipital pain, possible clavicle, well no. He has an abrasion to the right hip, left flank, left thigh, left lower leg, and right medial knee, and right posterior calf. And right elbow, but full range of motion of all extremities with no tenderness or obvious deformity. So basic trauma labs,",,,,,

Um, she was getting a diaper change from the bed today, fell 3 feet from the bed to a rug over a hardwood floor. Mom said initially she picked him up and he kinda was stunned, he never like, seemingly lost consciousness or anything, but, looked kinda stunned and then started crying, um, then acted appropriate afterwards. So she watched him for a while, noticed the bruising, and so she, she uh, um then brought him in. But she said no vomiting or anything like that. But he does have brusiing to the right side of the head, fontanels are um flat, soft. Um, 24 gauge in the right foot, did not receive fluids or anything from--. So initially before the CT though he was nursed at --. There's been no vomiting or anything after that that was documented or recorded. Umm.. pupils are both reactive, but couldn't see both of them at the same time to tell you if they were equal. They were equal when he, the one time he opened his eyes, didn't get them to react, but did look at them and they did appear to be equal in size.",,,,,

56,(00:16:53),"And our primary survey is negative, secondary survey is positive for left scalp swelling",,,,,
57,(00:17:00),"So, just to review,",,,,,
58,(00:17:02),Contusions on the right side. Is that correct?,,,,,
59,(00:17:04),"I'm ah- pretty sure it's on the left posterior scalp, I didn't see anything on the right.",,,,,
60,(00:17:07),No? Ok.,,,,,

Primary survey is negative. We have a GCS of 14 at this point uh with a 4, 4, 6. With a left parietal skull fracture. Uh could we get a repeat blood pressure please?

Um, I know somebody was concerned in my initial report to you that he does have bradycardia, but it does, it is irregular. It will go up in the eighties, comes back down. Stimulate him with a pain response, heart rate goes up. He's satting 100%. Um, not getting him to open his jaw. Uh, believe he was, our responders state that when they got there, he was not restrained. It was a frontal, front right MVC, significant damage to an SUV. Um, do believe the face was struck, does have facial trauma. The rest of my trauma assessment was normal for him. He's uh, mom gives a weight somewhere in the eighties, so I went with 40 kilos.
