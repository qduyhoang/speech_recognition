70,(0:14:20),Do you think we should go ahead intubate him?,,
71,(0:14:21),Probably we should go intubate him,,
72,(0:14:22),"We should go intubate him. We're presuming there's a head injury, anesthesia. What would you like",,
,,,,
100,(0:17:29),Do we tube him first?,,
101,(0:17:30),Tube him first yeah yeah tube him,,
102,(0:17:31),We'll intubate him and then we're gonna move directly to head CT and then maybe check with our survey,,
103,(0:17:36),No I have not,,
104,(0:17:41),"We'll survey while there intubating, just to make sure they know what there injury is",,
,,,,
107,(0:18:02),Tell us when you're ready to intubate him,,
108,(0:18:10),Okay so we're gonna go ahead intubate him and then we're gonna move him to head CT. I'm gonna call neuro surgery,,
,,,,
126,(0:20:39),Suction and [atomizer?] are both in,,
127,(0:20:43),Suction and [automadate?] in,,
,,,,
133,(0:21:08),What size tube did you put in?,,
,,,,
157,(0:23:16),And where is he taped?,,
158,(0:23:26),Where's his tube taped?,,
159,(0:23:28),Fifteen and a half,,

13,0:07:10,"Alright airway, patient's intubated, breath sounds are clear bilaterally",,
,,,,
,,,,
161202,,,,
32,0:05:44,"Please secure the airway --, can we proceed with intubation, we don't need meds to facilitate this",,
,,,,
108,0:09:12,"Okay, do I have some-",Request,
109,0:09:15,And anesthesia's here to facilitate,Request,
110,0:09:18,"** towards you, look at the screen",Command,
111,0:09:21,You wanna push out,Request,
112,0:09:21,Right here,Report,
113,0:09:23,The body shop,Request,
114,0:09:24,Yeah,Report,
115,0:09:24,Right there,Report,
116,0:09:27,Perfect,Report,
117,0:09:30,Is it tight,Request,

122,0:09:40,Yes --,Report,
123,0:09:41,And you have anesthesia to facilitate,Report,
,,,,
132,0:10:03,We're currently working on intubating him,,
,,,,
187,0:12:18,Can you get a 3.0 ready,,
188,0:12:19,"Okay, what I'd like to do is see what his direct is",,
189,0:12:24,Another attempt at the airway with anesthesia,,
190,0:12:37,"So guys I just wanna take stock of where we're at, we're now 5 doses of epi, we're still working on securing an airway",,
,,,,
212,0:14:00,"Fourth attempt at the airway, with a 3.0, anesthesia",,
,,,,
,,,,
170438,,,,
5,(00:32:50),We need to secure the airway please and intubate her. Deep breath in,,
6,(00:32:54),"No, don't intubate her yet. Listen for breath sounds",,
,,,,
45,(00:35:29),3 go ahead and get ready to intubate her,,
56,(00:35:50),So continue the exposure and continue the secondary survey in spots where you're not gonna interrupt their intubation,,
,,,,
107,(00:39:51),"Okay patient is intubated, 3% saline to go in",,
108,(00:39:55),"Goal end-tidal should be about 40, guys. Goal end-tidal of 40.",,
109,(00:40:00),"Respiratory, we'd like end-tidals of 40.",,
,,,,
112,(00:40:12),17,,
113,(00:40:12),17,,
117,(00:40:34),End-tidals are too low,,
118,(00:40:35),Too high,,
119,(00:40:35),"Whenever we get a chance, we just need to know the tube size and where it's at",,
120,(00:40:39),"5, 5, 17, at the teeth",,
121,(00:40:41),"5, 5, 17, at the teeth?",,
122,(00:40:44),Yes,,
,,,,
141,(00:42:06),He hasn't gotten up there cause they're securing the airway,,
142,(00:42:09),"Yep, almost done",,
,,,,
158,(00:43:17),"When you secure the airway, let's elevate the head of the bed",,
159,(00:43:37),Is your airway secure? We need to move on.,,
160,(00:43:39),"Tube is secure, yeah",,
161,(00:43:40),Okay let's go,,
,,,,
,,,,
170421,,,,
8,(00:09:18),"Okay, airway is intubated.",,
9,(00:09:22),Is the tube in place? Can we confirm the tube is in place?,,
10,(00:09:27),We're we're hooking up the end-tidal right now,,
11,(00:09:28),"Ok let's hook it up right now, continue compressions",,
23,(00:10:19),Do we have our end-title hooked up?,,
24,(00:10:20),"Yeah, it's hooked up now",,
27,(00:10:24),"I want to check tube placement. I think that's number 1, it's airway.",,
32,(00:10:51),I need to confirm that the tube is in place. You can either check on your own with an end-tidal,,
33,(00:10:55),We have end-tidal,,
,,,,
,,,,
170420,,,,
10,(00:33:43),Airway intubated,,
18,(00:34:11),Can we get end-tidal hooked up?,,
24,(00:34:22),End-tidal hooked up,,
,,,,
39,(00:35:15),"Alright, so summation of the exam, um, he's intubated.",,
40,(00:35:20),Do we have an end-tidal?,,
41,(00:35:22),Yes,,
42,(00:35:22),End-tidal is normal,,
43,(00:35:24),"Ok, good, alright",,
,,,,
,,,,
170221,,,,
4,(00:31:45),"I don't know what the last report you got was, but when we walked into the room, he was not… the E2 tube was not through port.",,
5,(00:31:52),"We had to re-intubate him, we didn't have an n-title, we didn't have breath sounds. So she pulled the tube and re-intubated him with 2.5 uncuffed.",,
,,,,
18,(00:32:45),Are we happy with that tube?,,
19,(00:32:46),They did a good job ---.,,
20,(00:32:47),"Anesthesia, are we comfortable with the tube placement right now?",,
21,(00:32:51),"Um, I mean are you able to ventilate?",,
23,(00:32:54),"As long as we're able to ventilate, that's fine.",,
,,,,
93,(00:36:18),How is he… is he easy to ventilate right now?,,
94,(00:36:20),We're trying to secure the airway right now. ,,
95,(00:36:22),We can.. The connection between the tube and the --- ….,,
96,(00:36:27),Where is the intubation --?,,
97,(00:36:28),"---, I want him sedated and paralyzed and then they can roll.",,
98,(00:36:31),"Okay, okay.",,
107,(00:37:09),Are you guys re-intubating or..?,,
108,(00:37:10),Yeah.,,
109,(00:37:11),I'm just getting ready.,,
110,(00:37:12),We have to reassess here because the --- is right where the juncture is so it keeps on getting disconnnected.,,
114,(00:37:26),"We're about to, we're about to as soon we find out what we're doing with the tube here.",,
115,(00:37:29),Okay.,,
,,,,
118,(00:37:44),...more and more distended.,,
119,(00:37:46),"Yeah, it is. Put like an OG or something in it?",,
120,(00:37:49),"Yeah, I think we need to put an OG or an NG in, it looks like his belly is getting more and more distended. ",,
121,(00:37:54),There is an NG.,,
122,(00:37:55),There's an NG in.,,
123,(00:37:56),"There's an OG in? Okay, suction it.",,
127,(00:38:07),"Hey, guys at the head, talk to us, tell us what's going on.",,
128,(00:38:09),We're just looking at the connection between the E2 tube.,,
129,(00:38:12),"Alright, so we can get in there and sedate him?",,
130,(00:38:14),Yeah.,,
133,(00:38:20),"Because it's at 13… So the tube was taped at 13, which is too deep at this age. So I'm gonna pull back.",,
134,(00:38:29),"Okay, so it is taped at 13…",,
135,(00:38:33),"It was taped at 13, I'm pulling it back.",,
142,(00:38:50),We are going to re-intubate because a leak is extensive.,,
143,(00:38:52),"Alright, use ROC instead of VEC please.",,
,,,,
154,(00:39:22),"Guys, there's too many people around the bed now, let's take care of the airway first. ",,
155,(00:39:25),So anybody who's not doing something please step backward for just a moment.,,
156,(00:39:27),"And just to be clear, we have a four month old, ex-26 weeker. We do not have a secure airway.",,
157,(00:39:32),We are gonna paralyze with ROC and sedate with fentanyl and versed now to secure an airway prior to doing the chest tube.,,
163,(00:40:09),Do we have an appropriate sized ---?,,
164,(00:40:12),Right here.,,
165,(00:40:14),And the suction?,,
166,(00:40:15),Suction is running.,,
,,,,
,,,,
170406,,,,
5,(00:10:44),Alright. Airway: patient's intubated.,,
7,(00:11:04),Check an end-tidal on the,,
,,,,
48,(00:14:48),I wanna change out his end-tidal to our on the monitor.,,
52,(00:15:34),"No abnormalities to the top of the head, he's got a small abrasion over the left eyebrow, he's got about a 1cm laceration to the right pinna. He's got blood around the mouth. He's intubated.",,
,,,,
,,,,
170304,,,,
4,(00:34:18),"Yes, in a car seat, 18-inch intrusion on her side. Came in unresponsive, the ER doctor there intubated her, 3-5 ET tube at 10 at the lip.",,
15,(00:35:26),"I think in the elevator, she was just having a few agonal respirations.",,
16,(00:35:31),Has she been fighting the vent at all?,,
17,(00:35:32),"Nope, absolutely no movement, no nothing. Nothing's pain, nothing at all.",,
18,(00:35:38),Alright.,,
19,(00:35:40),I'm undoing the CO2.,,
20,(00:35:53),"Respiratory, are you ready?",,
21,(00:35:54),I'm ready when y'all are.,,
22,(00:35:55),You guys ready?,,
23,(00:35:56),Ready.,,
24,(00:36:02),Clear?,,

26,(00:36:18),"Alright so airway is, airway is secure.",,
27,(00:36:21),"Well, we need to make sure there's n-tidal CO2 too, right? So..",,
28,(00:36:24),We had n-tidal - oh so sorry - in the thirties.,,
,,,,
42,(00:37:12),"Okay, we have good n tidal CO2?",,
43,(00:37:15),"No labs, the only thing they did was the finger stick close to 177.",,
44,(00:37:16),"Alright, so we have a CO2 22.",,
45,(00:37:18),Thank you.,,
48,(00:37:24),"Alright, CO2 is 30 --",,
,,,,
113,(00:45:59),How did her tube work?,,
114,(00:46:01),It's good.,,
115,(00:46:01),It's good?,,
