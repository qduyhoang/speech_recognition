53,(00:15:00),"It's hard to tell. He seems, the fact that he seems consolable, makes me think that he's just upset about everything going on, um",,,,
54,(00:15:20),He said that his eye hurts and his nose hurts,,,,
55,(00:15:24),"So, I mean given that he's in the live state, I mean, we could try to clear C-spine",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
170406,,,,,,
62,(00:16:41),"Um, so you can have someone hold c-collar and then you undo the c-collar and check the back, just for step-offs. So just gently slip your hand to the back and feel if there's any obvious deformities.",,,,
